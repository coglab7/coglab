The escape routes they used, established by Nazi sympathisers, came to be known as 'ratlines'. The escaping Nazis had helped from an unexpected source; senior figures within the Catholic Church.</p><p>The story of SS officer Walter Rauff exemplifies how these networks operated and the subsequent lives of the escapees. Rauff was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people during the Second World War and was a key perpetrator of the Holocaust. After escaping to Chile, he would eventually come to work for the brutal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. There he would go on to inflict further miseries on the Chilean people. Rauff was never put on trial, but is it possible to obtain a different kind of justice for his numerous crimes?</p><p>Philippe Sands, a renowned British-French lawyer and author, joins Dan to provide insights from his book '38 Londres Street: On Impunity, Pinochet in England and a Nazi in Patagonia', which explores Rauff's life and actions and the involvement of the Catholic Church.</p><p>Produced &amp; edited by Dougal Patmore.</p>","contentLength":1213,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/684051cc7a7872669a46fcfd/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&sig=uClhuO0xzOCsIjLm2QjfGSHAaMJgymht4UrfgOFaLbA","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"David Bentley Hart - Can Metaphysics Discern God?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSl3oP_4sA","date":1749394847,"author":"Closer To Truth","guid":594,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Follow Closer To Truth on Instagram for updates, announcements, and videos: https://shorturl.at/EzYo9\n\nMetaphysics is the deepest probe of reality.
