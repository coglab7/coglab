This learning is vital for understanding the world around us and guides our actions and decisions. We propose a novel framework to investigate how people learn from others' episodic memories, hypothesizing that in such learning, people take an evaluative stance to avoid acquiring misleading information. Information evaluated as more veridical will be more likely to be learned from. We review the cues used to evaluate others’ memories. These cues may be conveyed and interpreted automatically (e.g., various aspects of prosody), or more deliberatively (e.g., description of recollective content, overt metacognitive claims of certainty or specificity).</article>","contentLength":820,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The adaptive value of stubborn goals","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00278-5?rss=yes","date":1761609600,"author":"Eleanor Holton, Yael Niv, Jill X.

This strong attachment to goals can often appear irrational – a perspective captured by terms such as perseverance or sunk-cost biases. In this review, we explore how goal commitment could stem from several adaptive mechanisms, including those that optimise cognitive resources, shield decisions from interference, and scaffold motivation in the absence of accessible reward signals. We propose that these computational considerations have important implications for algorithmic architectures supporting decision making, including separate algorithms for goal selection and implementation, and for monitoring ongoing goals versus alternative sources of reward. Finally, we discuss how a variety of mechanisms supporting goal commitment and abandonment could relate to dimensions affected in mental health.</article>","contentLength":872,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How miscommunication can improve collective performance in social insects","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00280-3?rss=yes","date":1761609600,"author":"Bradley D.

This vision of ‘AI Surrogates’ promises to enhance research in cognitive science by addressing longstanding challenges to the generalizability of human subjects research. AI Surrogates are envisioned as expanding the diversity of populations and contexts that we can feasibly study with the tools of cognitive science. Here, we caution that investing in AI Surrogates risks entrenching research practices that narrow the scope of cognitive science research, perpetuating ‘illusions of generalizability’ where we believe our findings are more generalizable than they actually are. Taking the vision of AI Surrogates seriously helps illuminate a path toward a more inclusive cognitive science.</article>","contentLength":891,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Emotion and prediction errors: which ingredients matter?","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00281-5?rss=yes","date":1761004800,"author":"Marius C.

Here, we review how the canonical patterns of intra- and inter-cortical interactions that occur during perception and shifts of attention deviate from those predicted by predictive coding. We argue that these circuit interactions are better captured by alternative theories, which we summarize under the umbrella term BELIEF.

While decades of research have explored the impact of articulating emotions through language, the labeling process itself has received limited attention until recently.

Building on perceptual theories of emotion, we explore how this perspective provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying affect labeling. We then review existing research applying sequential sampling models to affect labeling, illustrating how it accounts for the different processes involved in labeling and may explain mechanisms underlying individual differences in the labeling process.</article>","contentLength":849,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Reconceptualizing cognitive listening","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00253-0?rss=yes","date":1760572800,"author":"Sven L.

The DRL framework explains how these three sets of abilities predict performance and resource engagement as a function of signal quality. It also provides a platform for characterizing similarities and differences in how normal-hearing, impaired-hearing, and non-native listeners process speech in challenging conditions.</article>","contentLength":846,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"No need to oppose metabolic and motivational theories","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00276-1?rss=yes","date":1760486400,"author":"Mathias Pessiglione, Antonius Wiehler","guid":69,"unread":true,"content":"<article>After a long and intense day at work, you find yourself so exhausted that you refuse to drive and join your friends at their dinner party; instead, you indulge in fast food and easy entertainment at home.

Although often celebrated, cooperation also has hidden costs. By presenting core mechanisms behind its emergence, we demonstrate that maintaining cooperation frequently relies on social control and coercion, which can lead to extortion and discrimination. Group cooperation further necessitates defining who belongs to the group, fostering exclusion and intergroup conflict. Free-rider concerns fuel scapegoating and polarization. These downsides challenge the notion of cooperation as a simple success story. The resulting conundrum for scientists is not just to explain cooperation but to identify institutions that harness its benefits while limiting its risks. Understanding these complexities is crucial to ensuring that human cooperation serves the common good rather than deepening social divides.</article>","contentLength":891,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"More than incurious: the development of deliberate ignorance","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00254-2?rss=yes","date":1760054400,"author":"Linda Kerbl, Zoe Rahwan, Ralph Hertwig, Simon Ciranka","guid":67,"unread":true,"content":"<article>In an information-rich world the ability to choose not to know is an important cognitive tool.

We propose that such difficulties should be understood within the broad framework of learning and skill acquisition. Behavioral and neural studies, as well as computational analyses, imply that acquiring expertise has atypical dynamics in dyslexia, largely due to reduced perceptual memory, which is manifested in faster decay of perceptual traces of both speech and non-speech stimuli. This faster behavioral decay is associated with faster decay of neural adaptation to stimulus regularities in perceptual cortices. We propose that these atypical dynamics lead to a slower accumulation of language statistics, manifested in reduced complexity of perceptual categories, slower acquisition of words, and – counterintuitively – larger relative difficulties as exposure to stimuli grows.</article>","contentLength":918,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sensory reformatting for a working visual memory","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00245-1?rss=yes","date":1759881600,"author":"Anastasia Kiyonaga, John T.

This is thought to occur in part by recruiting early ‘sensory’ cortical regions, via flexible fronto-parietal mechanisms. The nature of visual cortex activity during WM has been elusive, but new evidence suggests that early WM representations can transform from a sensory-like code into a format that is shaped by task context and optimized for behavior. Here, we review evidence for transformations in visual cortical WM coding, the various forms they take, and their functional importance. Visual cortex may be an active workspace during WM, where flexible and ‘good enough’ WM representations serve to interface with perception and action.</article>","contentLength":798,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Can only meat machines be conscious?","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00234-7?rss=yes","date":1759795200,"author":"Ned Block","guid":62,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Computational functionalism claims that executing certain computations is sufficient for consciousness, regardless of the physical mechanisms implementing those computations.

Current theories of consciousness are 'meat-neutral', but if specific physical substrates are necessary, AI may never achieve consciousness. Understanding whether consciousness depends on computational roles, biological realizers, or both, is crucial for assessing the prospects of consciousness in AI and less complex animals.</article>","contentLength":985,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A world of things and stuff","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00272-4?rss=yes","date":1759795200,"author":"Susan Hespos, Antonia Götz, Tijl Grootswagers","guid":63,"unread":true,"content":"<article>It appears simple that every entity in our perceptual array is a thing (object) or stuff (substance).
