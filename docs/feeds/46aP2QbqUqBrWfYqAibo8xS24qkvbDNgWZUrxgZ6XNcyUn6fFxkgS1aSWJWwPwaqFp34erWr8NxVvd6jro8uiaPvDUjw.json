I read that 50G is recommended. even though i have 30x3, will the storage be spread or should i have 50G per node minimum? Regardless, I want to increase my storage on all nodes. I deployed my nodes via terraform. can i just increase the storage value number or will this cause issues? How should I approach this, whats the best solution?
