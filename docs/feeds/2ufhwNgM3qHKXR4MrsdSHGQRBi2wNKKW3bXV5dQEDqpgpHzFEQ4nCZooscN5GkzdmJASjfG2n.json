While ex vivo and in vitro models are instrumental tools to study microglial function, the slicing or culturing process inherently leads to markedly altered microglial phenotypes. Understanding the nature of these limitations and developing better ex vivo and in vitro models are crucial for enhancing the utility of these methods. In this review, we discuss recent developments in ex vivo and in vitro microglia models, from cell cultures to brain slices, focusing on the mechanisms that may need to be considered when using these tools and interpreting the obtained results. We suggest that limitations of ex vivo and in vitro models also provide opportunities to better understand the mechanisms driving microglial phenotype changes in various disease states.</article>","contentLength":923,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Disambiguating dimensions of external and internal brain processes","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00199-7?rss=yes","date":1760745600,"author":"Freek van Ede, Daniela Gresch, Anna C.

Dopaminergic neurons, however, frequently form bouton-like structures that lack these conventional postsynaptic specializations. Recently, high-resolution imaging techniques such as electron microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy, along with nanosensors and in vitro models, have revealed the molecular identities and spatial organization of distinct vesicle pools in dopaminergic terminals. In this review, we discuss how recent findings have reshaped current understanding of dopamine vesicles, revealing a structural continuum that includes non-classical architectures. We highlight emerging concepts such as dopamine hub synapses and vesicle heterogeneity in dopaminergic terminals. Finally, we examine how dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease-associated proteins affects synaptic integrity and predisposes dopaminergic neurons to selective vulnerability.</article>","contentLength":985,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A tiny vertebrate reveals brain-scale network functions","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00211-5?rss=yes","date":1760313600,"author":"Zichen He, Jacob J.

We propose a novel anatomically informed cognitive framework, motivated by interacting corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loops as observed in different mammals. The framework shifts the perspective from a strict dichotomy toward a continuous, integrated network where behavior emerges dynamically from interacting circuits. Decisions within each loop contribute contextual information, which is integrated with goal-related signals in the basal ganglia input, building a network of dependencies. Loop-bypassing shortcuts facilitate habit formation. Striatal integration hubs may function analogously to attention mechanisms in Transformer neural networks, a parallel we explore to clarify how a variety of behaviors can emerge from an integrated network.</article>","contentLength":973,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Evolving perspectives on the molecular and neural foundations of mammalian circadian rhythms","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00195-X?rss=yes","date":1759968000,"author":"Yanqin Liu, Ran Huo, Eric E.

The classical transcriptional–translational feedback loop (TTFL) remains a foundational model, although recent studies have refined its mechanisms and exposed limitations. The discovery of RUVBL2 – an ancient core clock component conserved across eukaryotes – emphasizes the potential universality of fundamental timekeeping processes. In mammals, intercellular coupling enables the generation of precise and robust circadian rhythms in both metabolic and electrical activity within the central pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives external cues and coordinates systemic physiology to adjust to daily environmental changes. This review provides an updated perspective on mechanisms underlying the generation of mammalian circadian rhythms from molecular to neural and circuit levels.</article>","contentLength":978,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The postsubiculum as a head-direction cortex","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00190-0?rss=yes","date":1759881600,"author":"Adrian J.

Traditionally, these are divided into primary sensory systems that receive subcortical sensory signals, and higher-order systems that are driven predominantly by cortical activity. The rodent head-direction system – the neural ‘compass’ and a key input to the hippocampal formation – encodes orientation in the horizontal plane through a thalamocortical loop that links the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus and the postsubiculum. We argue that this circuit shares several hallmark features with canonical primary sensory systems, including a driver thalamic input, specific laminar targeting, and receptive field transformations. Drawing on recent anatomical and physiological studies in rodents, we propose that the postsubiculum functions as a primary cortex for the head-direction signal.</article>","contentLength":872,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Mesenchymal stromal cell extracellular vesicles as immune modulators and drug carriers in neurodegenerative disorders","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00194-8?rss=yes","date":1759881600,"author":"Lien Van Hoecke, Cristiano Lucci, Roosmarijn E.

MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) present a promising alternative, offering comparable or superior therapeutic effects while overcoming some of these challenges. MSC-EVs exhibit strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, which could be leveraged in neurodegenerative diseases given the central role of neuroinflammation in these conditions. Additionally, MSC-EVs can be engineered for targeted drug delivery, enhancing their clinical utility. In this review we highlight the dual role of MSC-EVs as immunomodulators and drug carriers in neurodegenerative disorders. We discuss the current challenges, and outline strategies for clinical translation. Future advances in understanding MSC-EVs and their mechanisms of action could support their development into effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.</article>","contentLength":996,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Modulation of viral neuroinflammation by astrocytic RIPK3 and serine protease inhibitors","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00198-5?rss=yes","date":1759795200,"author":"Ebba Rosendal, Anna K.

Applying a foraging framework grounded in behavioral ecology has enabled probing of the mechanisms underlying cognitive processes such as decision-making within a more ecological context. Yet, foraging also involves myriad other aspects, including navigation of complex environments, sensory processing, and social interactions. Here, we first provide a brief overview of the neuroscience of foraging decisions, and then combine insights from behavioral ecology and neuroscience to review the role of these additional dimensions of foraging. We conclude by highlighting four opportunities for the continued development of foraging as an ethological framework for neuroscience: integrating normative and implementation-level models, developing new tools, enabling cross-species comparisons, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.</article>","contentLength":933,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Pre- and post-decision signals of certainty in changing minds","url":"https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00196-1?rss=yes","date":1759622400,"author":"Pablo Barttfeld, Nicolás Comay, Iair Embon, Guillermo Solovey","guid":49,"unread":true,"content":"<article>In a recent study, Goueytes and colleagues combined computational modeling with intracranial recordings to dissect the neural basis of confidence and changes of mind.

When these predictions are in error, our knowledge base must be revised to remain relevant. Here, we propose that this error-driven updating of memory depends largely on the interplay between the hippocampus and locus coeruleus (LC), during which the former conveys information about surprise to the latter, signaling the magnitude of prediction error. Small prediction errors promote editing of existing memories, whereas large prediction errors lead to the formation of new episodic memories. We suggest that this memory curation process is central to adaptive behavior, extending classical views on the contributions of the LC to cognition.</article>","contentLength":750,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["cognitive-neuroscience","review"]}
