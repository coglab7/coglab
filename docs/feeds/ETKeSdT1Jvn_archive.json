The escape routes they used, established by Nazi sympathisers, came to be known as 'ratlines'. The escaping Nazis had helped from an unexpected source; senior figures within the Catholic Church.</p><p>The story of SS officer Walter Rauff exemplifies how these networks operated and the subsequent lives of the escapees. Rauff was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people during the Second World War and was a key perpetrator of the Holocaust. After escaping to Chile, he would eventually come to work for the brutal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. There he would go on to inflict further miseries on the Chilean people. Rauff was never put on trial, but is it possible to obtain a different kind of justice for his numerous crimes?</p><p>Philippe Sands, a renowned British-French lawyer and author, joins Dan to provide insights from his book '38 Londres Street: On Impunity, Pinochet in England and a Nazi in Patagonia', which explores Rauff's life and actions and the involvement of the Catholic Church.</p><p>Produced &amp; edited by Dougal Patmore.</p>","contentLength":1213,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/684051cc7a7872669a46fcfd/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&sig=uClhuO0xzOCsIjLm2QjfGSHAaMJgymht4UrfgOFaLbA","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"David Bentley Hart - Can Metaphysics Discern God?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSl3oP_4sA","date":1749394847,"author":"Closer To Truth","guid":594,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Follow Closer To Truth on Instagram for updates, announcements, and videos: https://shorturl.at/EzYo9\n\nMetaphysics is the deepest probe of reality.

Under German occupation, islanders suffered under a repressive regime… Some were even sent to internment camps in Germany. In return, thousands of prisoners of war were brought over to work as slave labourers, building the Nazi’s extensive defence network across the island.&nbsp;</p><p>On the 80th anniversary of its liberation, Dan explores the island and tells the story of Jersey’s suffering and resilience under enemy control.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was made in collaboration with Visit Jersey.

He thrives in paradox: he overcomplicates the simple, oversimplifies the complex, and yet somehow lands on solutions that feel inevitable in hindsight. He believes that true innovation exists in the tension between chaos and structure—too much of either, and you’re stuck.</p><p>His career has been anything but linear. He’s owned and operated successful restaurants, served high-stakes cocktails while juggling bottles on London’s bar tops, and later traded spirits for code—designing digital waiters, recommender systems, and AI-driven accounting tools. Now, he leads the AI Builders Club Amsterdam, a fast-growing community where AI engineers, researchers, and founders push the boundaries of intelligent systems.</p><p>Ask him about RAG, and he’ll insist on specificity—because, as he puts it, discussing retrieval-augmented generation without clear definitions is as useful as declaring that “AI will have an impact on the world.” An engaging communicator, a sharp systems thinker, and a builder of both technology and communities, Fausto is here to challenge perspectives, deconstruct assumptions, and remix the future of AI.</p><p>Moravec's paradox: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox?utm_source=chatgpt.com</p><p>Behavior Modeling, Secondary AI Effects, Bias Reduction &amp; Synthetic Data // Devansh Devansh // #311: https://youtu.be/jJXee5rMtHI</p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExplore</p><p>Join our Slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]</p><p>Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] </p><p>Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]</p><p>MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]</p><p>Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkm</p><p>Connect with Fausto on LinkedIn: /stepintoliquid</p><p>Timestamps:[00:00] Fausto's preferred coffee[00:26] Takeaways[01:18] Automated Ad Creative Generation[07:14] AI in Marketing Workflows[13:23] MCP and System Bottlenecks[21:45] Forward Compatibility vs Optimization[29:57] Unlocking Workflow Speed[33:48] AI Dependency vs Critical Thinking[37:44] AI Realism and Paradoxes[42:30] Outsourcing Decision-Making Risks[46:22] Human Value in Automation[49:02] Wrap up</p>","contentLength":3019,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/102640825/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-4-14%2F400253800-44100-2-ae06b89630cc1.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Glorious Revolution","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-glorious-revolution","date":1747179000,"author":"","guid":522,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/682277c8986466935de893cf/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&sig=28Mx3MTV5-SMEOJc4VUWQsRImLv3B5nDg530SCVtoRw","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Joe Rogan Experience #2320 - Tom Segura","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAKkM5R6eU","date":1747155614,"author":"PowerfulJRE","guid":596,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Tom Segura is a stand-up comedian, actor, podcaster, and author.
