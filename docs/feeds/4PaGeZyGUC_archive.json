They live and work on the island. But everyday life in this supposed paradise is also sometimes overshadowed by existential worries and loneliness.\n\nThe Portuguese island of Madeira lies in the Atlantic Ocean. It is known as the island of eternal spring. With its pleasant climate and community, the village of Ponta do Sol attracts young freelancers like Nina and Heiko. But rents and the general cost of living here have risen sharply, pricing out locals.\nNina arrived in Madeira in 2021. Her goal: to set up a \"digital village‚Äù for young freelancers in Ponta do Sol. The young woman from Munich is still here, but things have changed since the early days. Most freelancers only stay for a few months and then move on. With such a transient community, it‚Äôs difficult to build close friendships.\nThe \"first village for digital nomads‚Äù advertised on social media mainly consists of a co-working space where freelancers can work for free. The high turnover of travelers inspired Nina to come up with her business idea: she manages shared flats, known as ‚Äòco-livings‚Äô, where freelancers can find a ‚Äòtemporary home‚Äô.\nHeiko is packed and ready and dreaming of a life on the island. \"Madeira is definitely my dream destination,‚Äù he says. The graphic designer has loved the island since he was a child. Now he wants to gain a foothold there with the help of the digital community.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #portugal #madeira #digitalnomad \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The raw material interests of rich nations often trump the rights and needs of the local populations.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of Congo, people are being exploited in mines. Chinese traders are illegally buying cobalt, a material Europe needs for its green energy transition. Therefore, Europe buys the cobalt from these illegal traders. The EU now wants to free itself from its dependence on China for raw materials and expand its own local activities. They promise to act more fairly than China - though some say this is not a reasonable promise.\nA huge hydrogen project involving Germany is being planned on the south-east coast of Namibia. The local population is also supposed to benefit from it. However, parts of a national park will be destroyed by the billions being spent in the name of green investment. \"Why doesn't Germany sacrifice its own protected parks for green hydrogen?‚Äù asks Namibia's well-known environmental activist Chris Brown. \nIn the oil-contaminated mangrove forests of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, it becomes clear that Europe is not as climate-friendly as it likes to claim. After all, since the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, numerous European investors have been attempting to discreetly arrange lucrative natural gas deals in the country. Congolese activist Patricia Kashala also complains that Europe gives the impression of acting in an exemplary manner, but in practice often puts its own interests in raw materials above the rights of the local population.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #africa #europe #china \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary O‚ÄôReilly learn about Nobel-prize-winning Alphafold, the protein folding problem, and how solving it could end disease with AI researcher and Chief AI Officer of Isomorphic Labs, Max Jaderberg. \n\nWe break down the protein folding problem and why it was so hard to crack. How do we learn to decode how strings of amino acids fold into complex, dynamic shapes that power our biology? How did AlphaFold crack this decades-old puzzle? We explore how Alphafold 3 uses the shapes of proteins to predict protein-drug interactions. How close are we to using AI and deep learning to design new medicines instead of discovering them by chance? Could generative AI invent molecules that precisely target the cause of a disease?\n\nWe take these ideas into the future: Could AI help us fix misfolded proteins that cause illness? Can we use these tools to create personalized drugs tailored to your unique genome? Will it make it economically feasible to treat rare diseases? Could this even help us slow aging or regenerate limbs, like salamanders do? Could this technology combat cancer, fix rare genetic disorders, or even digest plastic?

Australia 2024. #GOTOcon #YOW\nhttps://yowcon.com\n\nHolly Cummins - Senior Principal Software Engineer on the Red Hat Quarkus Team @Holly_Cummins \n\nRESOURCES\nhttps://hollycummins.com\nhttps://hollycummins.com/type/blog\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/hollycummins.com\nhttps://hachyderm.io/@holly_cummins\nhttps://twitter.com/holly_cummins\nhttps://github.com/holly-cummins\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/holly-k-cummins\n\nABSTRACT\nInefficiency is ruining our planet and our lives. Efficiency is ruining our happiness, and weirdly, it‚Äôs also ruining our efficiency. Heeeeelppp!? What‚Äôs a techie to do? Zombie servers and slow code are a big climate problem, but the vrrrooom model gives us double-win hope. Holly walks through a range of techniques that can be used to find and eliminate software waste and reduce climate impacts.\n\nBut machine efficiency isn‚Äôt much use without human efficiency. Surprisingly, sorting out machine efficiency often helps humans, too. For example, the Quarkus Java framework uses many interesting waste-reduction techniques. These optimisations have the dual benefit of speeding up computers, and also speeding up people.\n\nSo far, so good, but we need to be careful we don‚Äôt end up accidentally optimising the wrong things, and making stuff worse. 100% utilisation is not sustainable for either humans, or people.

Continuous Delivery is state of the art for software development, it is how most of the best software companies in the world work. So how close is your organisation to achieving Continuous Delivery? CD is the best way to organise your work, but it is not an easy process to adopt. So what are the markers of success, what are the targets to aim for, and the measuring sticks that will help you evaluate where you are now, and what next steps you should take.\n\nIn this episode, Dave Farley, author of the book that introduced Continuous Delivery as an approach, explores these questions and defines a checklist of 14 markers that if you are achieving them clearly state that you are indeed practicing CD and building better software faster. These are excellent tools to help you on your journey and can help you to decide where to next focus your efforts to improve. \n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS &amp; LINKS\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\nDavid Farley ‚Ä¢ Modern Software Engineering ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3GI468M\nDave Farley &amp; Jez Humble ‚Ä¢ Continuous Delivery ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nForsgren, Humble &amp; Kim ‚Ä¢ Accelerate ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/367RI5o\nGojko Adzic &amp; David Evans ‚Ä¢ 50 Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/50quickideas\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #ContinuousDelivery #CD #DORA #ContinuousDeliveryChecklist #Programming #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon  #ProgrammingTutorial #SoftwareEngineering #ModernSoftwareEngineering\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Tom emphasizes the importance of simplicity, collaboration, and transparency in development, especially when it comes to API design and managing system dependencies. They also explore best practices for team communication, the evolving role of platform engineering, and the shift toward a future where infrastructure is abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on software creation.\n\nTogether, they envision a world where better tools and AI lower the barrier to entry for developers, driving innovation and enabling more people to bring their ideas to life.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSimon Brown ‚Ä¢ Software Architecture for Developers Vol. 2\n (https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture) David Farley ‚Ä¢ Modern Software Engineering\n (https://amzn.to/3GI468M) Kim, Humble, Debois, Willis &amp; Forsgren ‚Ä¢ The DevOps Handbook\n (https://amzn.to/47oAf3l) Simon Wardley ‚Ä¢ Wardley Maps\n (https://amzn.to/45U8Upr) Simon Wardley ‚Ä¢ Wardley Mapping, The Knowledge\n (https://amzn.to/3XQEeDu) David Anderson, Marck McCann &amp; Michael O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ The Value Flywheel Effect\n (https://amzn.to/3VcHxC) Mike Amundsen ‚Ä¢ Restful Web API Patterns &amp; Practices Cookbook (https://amzn.to/3C74fpH) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

It is a region full of evidence of the connections early Christians made here with places and events in the Bible, from Moses to the baptism of Jesus.\n\nThe journey begins overlooking the Jordan Valley on Mount Nebo, the site of the death of Moses and a place of pilgrimage for centuries.\n\nNear Mount Nebo, at Madaba, Dan discovers one of the most extraordinary maps of the ancient world, created by the Christian community here in the 5th century AD. It is a spectacular layout of the Holy Land and the world as these early Christians saw it, from Egypt to Lebanon, including a detailed representation of Jerusalem with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at its heart. \n\nTravelling to the banks of the River Jordan itself, Dan then encounters archaeological discoveries revealing the veneration of this place‚Äôs association with Elijah and John the Baptist for centuries. This is believed to be Bethany Beyond the Jordan, a location where faith and history coincide as excavations have uncovered 5th century AD buildings commemorating the spot where early Christians believed John baptised Jesus and where His ministry began.\n\nThis is a fascinating journey into the past and the powerful connections made between faith and real places on the ground for millennia.\n\nThere is more information about the Baptism Site here:\n\nhttps://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1446/\n\nhttps://www.baptismsite.com/books/BaptismSite_WhitePaper.pdf\n\nTo find out more about Jordan, visit: https://visitjordan.com/\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

It's story.\n\nPati Jinich speaks with Chelsa Racette (Founder of Indigenous Fashion Week), Kim Coltman (Producer, Indigenous Fashion Week), and Tyson Martell (Model &amp; Actor) to explore how indigenous fashion is reshaping the industry, reclaiming space, and creating new opportunities for indigenous creatives.\nChelsa started modeling over a decade ago and saw the lack of Indigenous representation firsthand. In 2012, she founded Indigenous Fashion Week to change that. Kim modeled in the 1970s, when she was not even called by her name and only referred to as ‚Äúthe Indian.‚Äù She shares how painful that was ‚Äî and how proud she is to now help open doors for others. They talk candidly about access, erasure, and the power of visibility. About how the runway can be sacred. About smudging before shows. About teaching young people that it‚Äôs okay to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm indigenous,‚Äù with pride.\n\nWhat began as fashion shows has become a full-scale movement ‚Äî rooted in ancestry, but with eyes set firmly on the future. As Chelsa says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here and we‚Äôre human beings.‚Äù\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

When night falls, the most diverse worlds come together here. A journey through one of the most fascinating metropolises in the world -- from sunset to sunrise.\n\nShortly after sunset, work begins for the men and women who collect the garbage. On Copacabana Beach, a whole armada is out sifting through the sand and preparing the beach for the next day. Because the metropolis of millions is so busy all day, Luiz da Silva and his colleagues also empty the city‚Äòs garbage cans in the middle of the night. \n\nMeanwhile, crocodile researcher Ricardo Freitas sails his small boat in a lagoon, in the west of the city. The wild side of Rio comes to the fore at night: thousands of caimans populate the city's waters.\n\nJacky Rocha also works at night. She is a samba singer and tours Rio's nightlife, going from gig to gig. Her rehearsals for carnival are already in full swing. But she can always make time for a concert in the trendy harbor district. Samba, she says, is more than just carnival and good-mood music - it is a weapon in the fight against racism.\n\nRio de Janeiro is also a city of extreme inequality. While some people are still dancing and partying, others are starting their working day. Nanny Gilmara dos Santos lives in one of Rio's poor and dangerous suburbs. To get to work on time for a rich family in the wealthy south of the city, she has to leave her home at night.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the world of Candombl√©: The Afro-Brazilian religion was banned for a long time and had to be practiced in secret. Even today, its practitioners must still contend with prejudice. During the hour-long night-time rituals, the gods, or ‚Äòorix√°s‚Äô, are summoned with drums, singing and dancing, to take possession of the believers.\n\nAll the different people the filmmakers meet are united by a tireless optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable social and economic hurdles. Rio de Janeiro at night shows viewers a city of hard work and big dreams. It‚Äôs a place that rewards its inhabitants, the Cariocas, with its beauty every morning, at sunrise\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #brazil #riodejaneiro #travel \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The whales make a beeline for the hulls and rudders. Researchers are trying to find out why. It is curiosity? Competition for food? Or maybe they‚Äôre just playing?\n\nIn the oceans of the world that are their realm, orcas have no natural predators. The highly developed marine mammals move in close social structures and are unmistakable due to the white spots behind their eyes. Also known as killer whales, they have a prominent triangle-shaped dorsal fin.\nSince the end of the first coronavirus lockdown in May 2020, an Atlantic orca population has been ramming sailing boats in the Strait of Gibraltar, off the Iberian Peninsula and up into the Bay of Biscay off the French coast. The animals follow the boats and ram the rudders until they are destroyed.\nThere are several theories explaining the phenomenon. Among them, the idea that this behavior is learned and spread through imitation within the pod. Experts call the encounters \"interactions‚Äù and no humans have been harmed so far. \nIn other regions of the world, other new behaviors have been observed in some orca populations. Orcas are sociable and intelligent animals. Sometimes, they are obviously trying out new things, like techniques for hunting.\nResearchers largely agree that the Gibraltar killer whales are under severe stress. There‚Äôs heavy marine traffic in the strait and along the entire Iberian coast. Humans and animals compete for tuna, and noise pollution is high.\nThe documentary hears from researchers, scientists and the boat crews themselves, about the unusual behavior of these animals.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #orca #gibraltar \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

No matter how many machines you throw at the problem, it never seems to get materially faster. Sometimes it feels like swimming through molasses. Have you ever wondered why?\n\nThis talk will explore such phenomena by discussing how coordination and synchronization protocols introduce costly overhead. We will examine experimental evidence from both academic settings and industrial sources. Together, we will learn about mental and conceptual models to help structure problems such to prevent runtime slowdowns.\n\nCome for the distributed systems content, stay for the pragmatic solutions.

Makes sense. Driving a longer distance takes longer.\n\nHere's the catch: other emergency services like police and fire don't actually have this same problem; it's relatively unique to ambulances. It turns out that emergency response time is about a little more than distance. Something is different about ambulances that is slowing them down in rural areas of the US.\n\nThat difference starts with the ways that ambulance services are funded in most of the US: Instead of being paid for by taxes like police and fire services are, ambulances are often paid for by a sort of a la carte model ‚Äî the more people they take to the hospital, the more they get reimbursed. It's a model that works well for emergency services in densely populated areas, but less well for everyone else. In this video, we look at how exactly that translates into longer response times, and what can be done to fix it.\n\nNote: A previous version of this video contained an incorrect graphic at 6:00. The graphic has been removed.\n\nFurther reading:\nYvonne‚Äôs paper about Ambulance deserts: https://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=ems \n\nEmergency response time compared in rural, urban, and suburban areas: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5831456/\n\nHistory of EMS: https://indianahealth.care/history-of-ems \n\nAmbulance billing explained (for Boston, but speaks to more general billing as well): https://www.boston.gov/departments/emergency-medical-services/ambulance-bill-frequently-asked-questions\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The film also visits one of Japan's few surviving ancient towns, as well as one of the country's most famous gardens. The railway and the city are inextricably linked. Even the Shinkansen high-speed train livery is based on the colors of a local palace.\n\nOne tourist highlight is a small special train that hugs the coastline and serves sushi. The Kanazawa railway hub is a microcosm of Japan‚Äôs national train network.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #japan #train #kanazawa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The trade is legal in Germany, even when the skulls date from the German colonial era.\n\nThis reportage reveals the questionable nature of this trade in skulls -- especially when their origin becomes clear. Thousands of human skulls were shipped to Germany during the colonial era, in a bid to support so-called racial research theories. Some of them came from plundered graves, or were cut from the dead. For dealers at a market for curiosities on the German-Belgian border, the violent backstory is even made into a selling point.\n\nCustoms expert Daniel Bein says the trade in human skulls is not prohibited per se. But politicians are now evaluating the issue, and plan to introduce legislation that will ban private trade in human skulls and bones.\n\nThe filmmakers conduct research at home and abroad, visit an international market for human skulls, meet one of the largest dealers in London and speak to buyers in Germany. They also accompany people who are themselves searching for the skulls of their ancestors, to bring them back to their homeland.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #colonialhistory #africa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They‚Äôre no longer just book-keeping checks to satisfy the compiler. These days a good type system lets you express ideas about what your code does, what problems you're trying to solve, and what design constraints you're up against. But only if you know how to make use of them.\n\nSo let's take a look at the best of modern type systems and learn how to read &amp; write them. You'll see that they types are so much more than a tool for correctness - they're a whole design language. And with a good design language, you can speak more clearly to your computer, your software can speak more clearly to your team, and you can even learn to spot poorly-expressed ideas and find new opportunities for refactoring.

Pope Julius II wanted to restore the Eternal City to its former splendor. What was the relationship between the three great painters? What rivalries existed between them?\n\nPope Pius commissioned Michelangelo (1475-1564) to decorate the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The sculptor of ‚ÄòDavid‚Äô, who was at the height of his career, accepted this monumental task with reluctance. Behind the scenes, a young, aspiring painter spied on his older colleague and had no qualms about adopting his expressive style. He was not yet 30 years old and called Raphael (1483-1520). The child prodigy worked in the pontiff's public apartments. The death of Julius II and the election of his successor Leo X in February 1513 disrupted the rivalry. Then, a third competitor arrived in the capital: Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), a close confidant of Giuliano de' Medici, the new Pope's brother. The 61-year-old master enjoyed special privileges that, among other things, made it possible for him to dissect corpses for anatomical research.\n\nThere are no sources proving that the three geniuses saw one another during their time in the city, but it‚Äôs unlikely that their paths didn‚Äôt cross. One thing is certain: the concurrent presence of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael in Rome was the highlight of the Italian High Renaissance.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #art #rome \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A world where Docker was a job people did; K8S was a boyband (probably); Kafka was a euphemism for existential anxiety and Chaos Engineering meant, well, nothing as it hadn‚Äôt been invented yet. The Cloud ‚Ä¶ that was just weather to most people.\n\nIt is 2012, and Microservices appeared on the Thoughtworks Technology Radar. 10 years ago, in 2014, Martin Fowler and James Lewis wrote down something that caused a bit of a stir ‚Äì the definition of Microservices. 10 years later, for better or worse, Microservices have become the predominant architectural style for building software at scale.\n\nSo much innovation has occurred in the last decade ‚Äì Docker and K8S fulfilled the ‚Äòwrite once and run anywhere‚Äô promise of the JVM. Operations changed beyond recognition as we moved to Cloud Native and FaaS. Testing in Production is a practice that now signifies maturity rather than derangement.\n\nIn this keynote, James takes a look at the original nine characteristics of Microservices and explores the lessons we‚Äôve learnt since those halcyon days. (Although Kafka is still a euphemism for existential anxiety.)

According to the Aborigines, the ‚Äòking‚Äô eucalyptus, which can grow up to 100 meters high, has mythical power.\n\nThis mythical power is said to originate from the so-called Dreamtime, the time before the creation of the world, in which only spiritual and immaterial things existed.  For the Aborigines, the eucalyptus tree symbolizes a connection between heaven and earth and enables communication with the spirits. \n\nAnother special feature of the eucalyptus forest is its relationship to fire: eucalyptus leaves contain essential oils, which in turn consist of highly flammable mixtures. The bark of the tree is thus highly flammable and acts as a fire accelerant. As a result, the tree ignites fires beneath it. These fires are necessary for the renewal of the forest: Light and root competition are reduced and nutrient-rich ash is produced.\n\nTo ensure their survival in a forest that regularly burns, the inhabitants have developed cooperative strategies. After a fire, new fronds sprout from the top of the tree fern, in a kind of basket. Some trees drop their seeds into these baskets, where they then germinate. This gives them a height advantage. Their roots wrap around the fern and the trees grow, winning the battle for sunlight. The animal world also contributes to the stability of the ecosystem: Lyrebirds rummage through the undergrowth with their huge claws, promoting the regrowth of new plants. Rabbit kangaroos feed on truffles that grow on the roots of the eucalyptus trees. In doing so, they distribute the spores of the fungi that supply the trees with water and nutrients. In spite of - and precisely because of - the fires, the ecosystem of the eucalyptus forest regulates itself.\n\nHowever, humans are disturbing this natural balance. Global warming and humans‚Äò use of forests are increasingly leading to large fires. These destroy millions of hectares of forest -- and spare hardly any living creatures. A natural system that is thousands of years old is in danger.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #australia #trees \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The Allied victory brought an end to Adolf Hitler's 12-year rule. Journal  entries from Hitler's supporters and opponents offer insight into life in Nazi Germany.\n\nThis four-part documentary series centers on eight individuals and their families. Each kept a diary recording their daily lives, experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Illustrations accompany the entries to bring them to life, giving these sequences the look of a graphic novel.\n\nThe eight diarists lived scattered across Germany. They came from different socioeconomic backgrounds, religions, and political factions. Some become fervent supporters of the Nazi regime, others opposed it, and some were marginalized or persecuted. Several of the journal span the entire 12 years of Hitler's rule. But some fall silent after a given time. \"Hitler's Reich - A German Journal\" features no expert testimonies; instead, the diaries stand alone, as personal records of the time in which they were written.\n\nIn the entries, we find descriptions of moments of happiness, youth, dance lessons, longing and love; but also of the first - still hesitant - Nazi salute, Gestapo surveillance, \"Aryan certificates,\" hunger, and the threat of deportation. They capture a time when many looked the other way, remained silent, or became complicit. They speak of what it felt like when the war \"came home,\" the fear of nights spent in bunkers, and the hope of survival. The diarists wrote with the urgency of the present, not knowing what tomorrow would bring.  Their stories reflect the rise, reign, and eventual downfall of the Nazi regime. \n\n[Parts 1-4 will be published weekly.

One key contributor  was the German Air Force, the Luftwaffe, who dominated the skies over France in 1940. But why was the Luftwaffe so successful? To find out, we joined forces with Christoph Bergs from Military Aviation History.\n\nFrom the Scramble Exhibition at IWM Duxford Christoph looks at three case studies. The crossings of the Meuse, the bombing of Dunkirk and Operation Paula, the last full out attack against the French Air Force in June 1940. These will help us understand the success of the Luftwaffe in France, as well as some of the problems that only got worse as the war went on.\n\nCheck out Chris's channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@MilitaryAviationHistory\n\nPlan your visit to IWM Duxford: https://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-duxford\n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video from IWM Film: https://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_3aPnqm9g\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/I_W_M\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/imperialwarmuseums/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/iwm.london\n @MilitaryAviationHistory  \n\nThumbnail Image Attributions:\nBundesarchiv_Bild_101I-385-0587-07,_Flugzeug_Heinkel_He_111_H-Z from Wikimedia Commons.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice discuss higher dimensions, dividing by zero, and math‚Äôs unsolved questions with math YouTuber Grant Sanderson @3blue1brown \n\nWe explore the Clay Millennium Problems: seven unsolved puzzles in mathematics, with a 1 million dollar prize. Grant shares his early fascination with the Twin Prime Conjecture. Are there infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by two? We pivot to the Navier-Stokes equations and the question of whether fluid flow can produce infinite energy density. How do physics and math come together? \n\nNeil recites the quadratic formula, launching a historical discussion on why equations of degree five or higher can‚Äôt be solved with a general formula, and how that impossibility gave rise to Galois theory. Listeners ask about dividing by zero, conformal geometry, tensor products, and category theory. Chuck gets lost. \n\nWe explore irrational numbers, why they‚Äôre called that, and why they are useful for physicists. We break down how Klein bottles work as four-dimensional objects. One listener asks if a new branch of math could solve the three-body problem.

This was less of a problem when interest rates were close to zero but in the era of trade wars, lower credit ratings and higher interest rates, debt is more expensive to issue and service. Bond investors have worried that governments are addicted to debt for quite some time, and recent drama in the Japanese bond market along with the deficit spending of Trump's \"one big beautiful bill\" lead many to question the ability of governments to cover massive budget deficits. This video looks at the drivers of growing government debt, what the money is spent on, can Elon Musk's DOGE cut spending and analyze the role of the 'bond vigilantes', to understand if huge budget deficits and government borrowing could spiral out of control. \n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ‚û°Ô∏è sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":2226,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/BjQUPiT-vmQ?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Timeline: Beavis And Butt-Head - The Complete History Of Beavis And Butt-Head","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWX5q3ZMLV0","date":1748181666,"author":"Weird History","guid":648,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Created and voiced by animator Mike Judge, Beavis and Butthead is an adult animated cartoon about two lazy, dim-witted teenagers who don‚Äôt care about much in this world beyond heavy metal and music videos.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary O‚ÄôReilly team up with pharmaceutical scientist and social media ‚Äúmedfluencer‚Äù Morgan McSweeny (aka Dr. Noc) to break down common internet medical myths from Big Pharma to raw milk to vaccine hesitancy. Plus a discussion with Academy Award Nominated filmmaker Scott Hamilton Kennedy (http://scotthamiltonkennedy65/) from SHOT IN THE ARM (https://shotinthearmmovie.com/) , a film where Neil served as Executive Producer and Script Consultant.\n\nWhy is the truth so boring compared to a good conspiracy? From ‚Äúcancer cures that Big Pharma is hiding‚Äù to miracle Himalayan salt and raw milk, we unpack the fact from the fiction dominating social feeds. We discuss what social media reveals about ourselves and why it's so hard to resist a digital car crash. Is it the algorithm or ourselves? \n\nAre natural remedies being suppressed? What do drug patents actually cover? Dr. Noc breaks down drug development, biologics vs. chemicals, and how misinformation distorts risk. Is pink salt healthier? Do raw diets help? Is fluoride in the water dangerous? We explore what red flags to look out for when consuming media, and the tribalism involved in mixing medical decisions with identity. \n\nThe conversation shifts to vaccines: What is a vaccine, and how does it actually work? Can you get too many? Can you ‚Äúboost‚Äù your immune system? What‚Äôs the real reason some vaccines need boosters while others don‚Äôt? Dr. Noc explains how the immune system works, why side effects happen, and why your immune system can handle yearly flu vaccinations. \n\nNext, Academy Award Nominated filmmaker Scott Hamilton Kennedy discusses how storytelling can fight misinformation. What is the ‚Äúsocial contract‚Äù of vaccination, and did the pandemic break it? Can we reclaim trust in science without falling into tribal traps of our own? From naturalist fallacies to freedom rhetoric, we examine where well-meaning skepticism crosses into denial. Is society willing to admit it has a problem? And what can we learn from past public health successes‚Äîand failures?\n\nThanks to our Patrons Boutayeb BADAOUI, Paris Daniel, Moe Erakat, Jeff Esposito, Ramon Thomas, Dunc Sargent, daniel gilligan, Justin Shillington, littledumbcane, Troy Oates, Ryan, Justin K, Andy Weber, Steven Chang, Roberta B, Linda Pretty, Brenda Gasch Mittelstadt, Bogaert Dieter, Gerry Casey, Heny Koundi, Trish Wallace, Zak Rooley, A W, Cairo, GIF, Alex Cimpoies Tamasan, chris bettis, Tom Izsak, Colin Harper, Dale Hawkins, Brandon Kavulla, Nancy Coltrin, Debbie, townpoem, Pratik Nagar, Caroline MacLeod, Svitlana Rahimova, polltery, Vinay Nambiar, David W Chandler, Hawaii Mike, Jan &amp; Blair Kinser, LadyofStyx, John Peterson, Sebastiano Catalano, Paris Kyriacopoulos, Alex Taylor, Terry Vaskor, Tim Raines, and nobody for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: Dr. Noc\n04:00 - A Safe Place For Misinformation\n11:00 - Are ‚ÄúThey‚Äù Hiding the Cure to Cancer\n16:21 - Natural Remedies\n18:22 - Raw Diets\n21:08 - Are GMO‚Äôs Bad For You?\n23:50 - Fluoride in the Water\n24:48 - How Do You Tell Information That‚Äôs Wrong?\n31:08 - Trusting Scientists\n34:45 - ‚ÄúDo Your Own Research‚Äù\n37:05 - How do Vaccines Actually Work\n40:18 - Can You Have Too Many Vaccinations?\n42:50 - Overloading &amp; Boosting Your Immune System\n51:53 - Introduction: Scott Hamilton Kennedy &amp; Shot in the Arm\n56:42 - What is Propaganda? \n58:28 - Remembering the Social Contract\n01:02:30 - How Do We Fix This?  \n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Too large for both the Panama and Suez canals she was instead built to travel through the world‚Äôs most unforgiving oceans. With advanced engineering and the reputation of Swan Hunter Shipbuilding behind her, many believed her to be all but unsinkable.\nSo when the Derbyshire vanished without a trace during Typhoon Orchid in September 1980, nothing about it made sense.

She revisits Houston, Texas, where thousands of homes remain in an area that already flooded during Harvey in 2017.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio dive into fan questions about the speed of light, time machine mistakes, and what Neil would do if he were an alien. \n\nCould a time machine land you in empty space because the solar system wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthere‚Äù yet? If Neil were an alien meeting a human for the first time, what would he ask about? Will there one day be more black holes in the universe than stars? And how exactly does gravity behave when energy is released during fusion?\n\nDo we understand the speed of light? We discuss how precise our measurement of the speed of light is. We get into how negative gravity would make a wormhole.

They can be triggered by stress, a shocking life event, or even too much nicotine, caffeine, or alcohol. Around one in three of you could suffer from a panic attack at least once in your life. Panic attacks are accompanied by physical signs and symptoms of anxiety and can include a rapid heart rate, feeling short of breath, feeling one is losing control, feeling detached from one‚Äôs body or reality or even feeling like one might die. Even if it feels awful, know that the panic won‚Äôt physically hurt you and that the attack will pass. \n\n‚ùóThings that can help during a panic attack: \n1Ô∏è‚É£ Breathe.\nPractice abdominal breathing: Breathe slowly from your abdomen through your nose to reduce symptoms of hyperventilation\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Stay in the present. \nStaying in the present and focussing on external objects will help minimize the attention you might give to troublesome physical symptoms or catastrophic thoughts. If possible, you might try actually touching objects nearby to reinforce staying in the immediate present or use the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise: 5: FIVE things you see around you. 4: FOUR things you can touch around you. 3: THREE things you hear. 2: TWO things you can smell. 1: ONE thing you can taste. \n\n3Ô∏è‚É£Know it will pass. \nEven if it feels awful, know that the panic won‚Äôt physically hurt you and that the attack will pass. \n\n4Ô∏è‚É£Be kind to yourself. \nIt‚Äôs okay to be scared, and you‚Äôre not alone. Practice positive self-talk and self-compassion to help reduce anxiety. You are stronger than you think and you can handle this. üíñ\n#kurzgesagt_inanutshell #kurzgesagt #inanutshell #panicattackhelp #panicattackawareness #selfhelp #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealth #learnwithshorts #science \n\nSources &amp; further reading: \nhttps://sites.google.com/view/kgs-tiktok-sources\n\nFollow us for more sciencey content! ü¶Ü\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ‚ù§ https://shop.kgs.link/shorts\nBecome a Part of kurzgesagt by joining the Patreon Bird Army üêß  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS &amp; SOCIAL MEDIA\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nBluesky:          https://kgs.link/bluesky\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\nThe Kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ‚ô¨‚ô™\n‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ‚ñÄ\n700+ minutes of Kurzgesagt Soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook</article>","contentLength":3820,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/kYOkrswU1KE?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Typing Demo XL - SA Blackest Black (i-Rocks Smaple keyboard, i-Rocks switches)","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85u0F-FESuU","date":1747257577,"author":"Chyrosran22","guid":57,"unread":true,"content":"<article>I got given a Signature Plastics set of SA Blackest Black keycaps recently! :D This TDXL was filmed under one of my blacklights as the keycaps have lettering that is only visible under UV light (the inner shot of the keycaps uses a fluorescent black plastic).
