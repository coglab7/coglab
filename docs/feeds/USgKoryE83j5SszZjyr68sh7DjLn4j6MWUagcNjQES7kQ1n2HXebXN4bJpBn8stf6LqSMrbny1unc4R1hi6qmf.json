From the time I did code, my background was mainly C++, Java &amp; Python. However, I've been in a more Platforms / DevOps role for a while and want to use Go to help write some K8s operators and other tools.</p><p>One thing I'm having trouble wrapping my head around is the  of functions within a file. For example, in C++ I would define  or the  at the bottom of the file, listing functions from bottom-&gt;top in order of how they are called. E.g.: ```cpp void anotherFunc() {}</p><p>void someFunc() { anotherFunc(); }</p><p>int main() { someFunc(); return 0; } <code> Within a class, I would put public at the top and private at the bottom while still adhering to the same order. E.g.: </code>cpp class MyClass { public: void funcA(); private: void funcB(); void funcC(); // this calls funcB so is below } ``` Similarly, I'd tend to do the same in Java, python and every other language I've touched, since it seems the norm.</p><p>Naturally, I've been defaulting to the same old habits when learing Go.

I know that Go's compiler supports it because of the way it parses the code but am unsure on why people order it this way. Is there a Go standard guide that addresses this kind of thing?
