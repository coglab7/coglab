Simons","guid":41,"unread":true,"content":"This study examined whether behavioral memory updating can reduce fear in adolescents with and without chronic pain. While self-reported fear did not differ, neural data revealed distinct vmPFC-amygdala connectivity supporting memory updating.","contentLength":243,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How disconfirmatory evidence shapes confidence in decision-making","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00325-3","date":1761696000,"author":"Kobe Desender","guid":38,"unread":true,"content":"Re-analyzing nine datasets and a new experiment, we show that confidence relies on evidence conflicting with one’s choice. This “response-incongruentevidence” effect reflects heightened sensitivity near decision boundaries during judgement.","contentLength":246,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Personal agency and social connection are associated with loneliness over time","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00329-z","date":1761696000,"author":"Todd Chan","guid":39,"unread":true,"content":"Longitudinal study shows loneliness is associated with distinct patterns of social connection and personal agency.
