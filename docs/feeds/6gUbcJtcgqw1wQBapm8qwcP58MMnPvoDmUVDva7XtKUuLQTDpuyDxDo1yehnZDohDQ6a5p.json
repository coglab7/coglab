Among his lasting contributions to Apple's computers were the invention of the menubar, the selection lasso, the \"marching ants\" item selection animation, and the discovery of a midpoint circle algorithm that enabled the rapid drawing of circles on-screen. \nHe was Apple Employee No. 51, recruited by Steve Jobs. Atkinson was one of the 30 team members to develop the first Macintosh, but also was principle designer of the Lisa's graphical user interface (GUI), a novelty in computers at the time. He was fascinated by the concept of dithering, by which computers using dots could create nearly photographic images similar to the way newspapers printed photos. He is also credited (alongside Jobs) for the invention of RoundRects, the rounded rectangles still used in Apple's system messages, application windows, and other graphical elements on Apple products. \nHypercard was Atkinson's main claim to fame. He built the a hypermedia approach to building applications that he once described as a \"software erector set.\" The Hypercard technology debuted in 1987, and greatly opened up Macintosh software development.\n \nIn 2012 some video clips of Atkinson appeared in some rediscovered archival footage. (Original Macintosh team developer Andy Hertzfeld uploaded \"snippets from interviews with members of the original Macintosh design team, recorded in October 1983 for projected TV commercials that were never used.\") \n\nBlogger John Gruber calls Atkinson \"One of the great heroes in not just Apple history, but computer history.\"\n\n If you want to cheer yourself up, go to Andy Hertzfeld's Folklore.org site and (re-)read all the entries about Atkinson. Here's just one, with Steve Jobs inspiring Atkinson to invent the roundrect. Here's another (surely near and dear to my friend Brent Simmons's heart) with this kicker of a closing line: \"I'm not sure how the managers reacted to that, but I do know that after a couple more weeks, they stopped asking Bill to fill out the form, and he gladly complied.\" \n\nSome of his code and algorithms are among the most efficient and elegant ever devised. The original Macintosh team was chock full of geniuses, but Atkinson might have been the most essential to making the impossible possible under the extraordinary technical limitations of that hardware... In addition to his low-level contributions like QuickDraw, Atkinson was also the creator of MacPaint (which to this day stands as the model for bitmap image editorsâ — âPhotoshop, I would argue, was conceptually derived directly from MacPaint) and HyperCard (\"inspired by a mind-expanding LSD journey in 1985\"), the influence of which cannot be overstated.\n\n I say this with no hyperbole: Bill Atkinson may well have been the best computer programmer who ever lived. Without question, he's on the short list. What a man, what a mind, what gifts to the world he left us.","contentLength":3207,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Ask Slashdot: How Important Is It For Programmers to Learn Touch Typing?","url":"https://ask.slashdot.org/story/25/06/07/0811223/ask-slashdot-how-important-is-it-for-programmers-to-learn-touch-typing?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1749317640,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":296,"unread":true,"content":"Once upon a time, long-time Slashdot reader tgibson learned how to type on a manual typewriter, back in an 8th grade classroom. \nAnd to this day, they write, \"my bias is to nod approvingly at touch typists and roll my eyes at those who need to stare at the keyboard while typing...\" But how true is that for computer professionals today?\n\nAfter 15 years I left industry and became a post-secondary computer science educator.

That includes the next version of iOS, which is rumored to have the most significant design overhaul since the introduction of iOS 7. Here's an overview of what to expect: \nMajor Software Redesigns \nApple plans to shift its operating system naming to reflect the release year, moving from sequential numbers to year-based identifiers. Consequently, the upcoming releases will be labeled as iOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, etc., streamlining the versioning across platforms.\n \niOS 26 is anticipated to feature a glossy, glass-like interface inspired by visionOS, incorporating translucent elements and rounded buttons. This design language is expected to extend across iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, promoting a cohesive user experience across devices. Core applications like Phone, Safari, and Camera are slated for significant redesigns, too. For instance, Safari may introduce a translucent, \"glassy\" address bar, aligning with the new visual aesthetics.\n \nWhile AI is not expected to be the main focus due to Siri's current readiness, some AI-related updates are rumored. The Shortcuts app may gain \"Apple Intelligence,\" enabling users to create shortcuts using natural language. It's also possible that Gemini will be offered as an option for AI functionalities on the iPhone, similar to ChatGPT.\n \nOther App and Feature Updates \nThe lock screen might display charging estimates, indicating how long it will take for the phone to fully charge. There's a rumor about bringing live translation features to AirPods. The Messages app could receive automatic translations and call support; the Music app might introduce full-screen animated lock screen art; and Apple Notes may get markdown support. Users may also only need to log into a captive Wi-Fi portal once, and all their devices will automatically be logged in.\n \nSignificant updates are expected for Apple Home. There's speculation about the potential announcement of a \"HomePad\" with a screen, Apple's competitor to devices like the Nest Hub Mini. A new dedicated Apple gaming app is also anticipated to replace Game Center.\n\nIf you're expecting new hardware, don't hold your breath. The event is expected to focus primarily on software developments. It may even see discontinued support for several older Intel-based Macs in macOS 26, including models like the 2018 MacBook Pro and the 2019 iMac, as Apple continues its transition towards exclusive support for Apple Silicon devices.\n \nSources:\nApple WWDC 2025 Rumors and Predictions!

So \"We're wondering what kind of online communities Stack Overflow users continue to support in the age of AI,\" writes their senior analyst, \"and whether AI is becoming a closer companion than ever before.\" \n\nFor their 15th year of their annual reader survey, this means \"we're not just collecting data; we're reflecting on the last year of questions, answers, hallucinations, job changes, tech stacks, memory allocations, models, systems and agents — together...\"\n\n Is it an AI agent revolution yet? Are you building or utilizing AI agents?

Did we make up the difference in salaries globally for tech workers...?\n \nThey're also re-visiting \"a key finding from recent surveys highlighted a significant statistic: 80% of developers reported being unhappy or complacent in their jobs.\"\nThis raised questions about changing office (and return-to-office) culture and the pressures of the industry, along with whether there were any insights into what could help developers feel more satisfied at work. Prior research confirmed that flexibility at work used to contribute more than salary to job satisfaction, but 2024's results show us that remote work is not more impactful than salary when it comes to overall satisfaction... [For some positions job satisfaction stayed consistent regardless of salary, though it increased with salary for other positions. And embedded developers said their happiness increased when they worked with top-quality hardware, while desktop developers cited \"contributing to open source\" and engineering managers were happier when \"driving strategy\".] \n\n In 2024, our data showed that many developers experienced a pay cut in various roles and programming specialties. In an industry often seen as highly lucrative, this was a notable shift of around 7% lower salaries across the top ten reporting countries for the same roles. This year, we're interested in whether this trend has continued, reversed, or stabilized. Salary dynamics is an indicator for job satisfaction in recent surveys of Stack Overflow users and understanding trends for these roles can perhaps improve the process for finding the most useful factors contributing to role satisfaction outside of salary. \nAnd of course they're asking about AI — while noting last year's survey uncovered this paradox. \"While AI usage is growing (70% in 2023 vs. 76% in 2024 planning to or currently using AI tools), developer sentiment isn't necessarily following suit, as 77% in of all respondents in 2023 are favorable or very favorable of AI tools for development compared to 72% of all respondents in 2024.\"\n\nConcerns about accuracy and misinformation were prevalent among some key groups. More developers learning to code are using or are interested in using AI tools than professional developers (84% vs. 77%)...

Unemployment for recent college graduates has jumped to an unusually high 5.8% in recent months, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently warned that the employment situation for these workers had \"deteriorated noticeably.\" Oxford Economics, a research firm that studies labor markets, found that unemployment for recent graduates was heavily concentrated in technical fields like finance and computer science, where AI has made faster gains. \"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates,\" the firm wrote in a recent report. \n\nBut I'm convinced that what's showing up in the economic data is only the tip of the iceberg. In interview after interview, I'm hearing that firms are making rapid progress toward automating entry-level work and that AI companies are racing to build \"virtual workers\" that can replace junior employees at a fraction of the cost. Corporate attitudes toward automation are changing, too — some firms have encouraged managers to become \"AI-first,\" testing whether a given task can be done by AI before hiring a human to do it. One tech executive recently told me his company had stopped hiring anything below an L5 software engineer — a midlevel title typically given to programmers with three to seven years of experience — because lower-level tasks could now be done by AI coding tools. Another told me that his startup now employed a single data scientist to do the kinds of tasks that required a team of 75 people at his previous company... \n\n\"This is something I'm hearing about left and right,\" said Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank, who studies the impact of AI on workers. \"Employers are saying, 'These tools are so good that I no longer need marketing analysts, finance analysts and research assistants.'\" Using AI to automate white-collar jobs has been a dream among executives for years.
