I only care about page views, which I find useful to figure out which pages get the most traffic. It’s interesting data, and sometimes rather useful. But Google collects much more information than just page views, and it’s tracking is more intrusive than I would like. But I had other things I’d rather spend to spend my time on, so doing anything about it never made it high enough up my todo list.</p><p>But last month I finally did something, having come across some information that did I thought did what I wanted. Essentially I want things set up so that I don’t need to bother with a cookie banner because I only track things that are trackable when someone says “deny all”. Based on <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?consentmode=basic\">some google documentation</a>, I changed my google analytics fragment to:</p><pre><code>&lt;script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-6D51F4BDVF\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\n  gtag('consent', 'default', {\n    'ad_user_data': 'denied',\n    'ad_personalization': 'denied',\n    'ad_storage': 'denied',\n    'analytics_storage': 'denied',\n    'wait_for_update': 500,\n  });\n  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n  gtag('config', 'G-6D51F4BDVF');\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre><p>As I understand the documentation, this should turn off the most problematic tracking, but still send a page view event. I took a look at it the following day, and everything seemed to be ok, but now, a couple of weeks later, page views reported by Google Analytics have dropped drastically. Not to zero, but to near zero.</p><p>I’ve spent a bit of time trying to figure out what’s happening. I used <a href=\"https://tagassistant.google.com\">google tag assistant</a> and it indicates the page view events are being sent correctly. But that doesn’t explain why I’m not seeing the page views in my Google data.</p><p>I’m not sure what to do next. I don’t want to spend too much time on this, after all I’d rather work on writing and editing. I did consider other services to do the tracking, but it looks we’re talking about $100s a month - and it’s just not worth that much to me. There are open source setups I could try an configure on my server, but again that’s effort I don’t really want to go into. Maybe I just live without analytics data.</p>","contentLength":2324,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Bliki: Say Your Writing","url":"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SayYourWriting.html","date":1748440200,"author":"Martin Fowler","guid":301,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Here's one of the best tips I know for writers, which was told to me by\n  Bruce Eckel.</p><p>Once you've got a reasonable draft, read it out loud. By doing this you'll\n  find bits that don't sound right, and need to fix. Interestingly, you don't\n  actually have to vocalize (thus making a noise) but your lips have to\n  move.\n</p><p>This advice is for those who, like me, strive to get a conversational tone\n  to their writings. A lot of people are taught to write in a different way\n  than they speak, but I find prose much more engaging with this conversational\n  tone. I imagine I'm sitting in pub, explaining the concepts to my companions.\n  I've heard people say that when reading my work, they can hear me speaking it\n  - which is exactly the effect I'm after. </p><p>Too often I read prose that feels flabby. Two kinds of flab stand out:\n  corporate prose and academic prose. I often tell people that if they read\n  their prose and it sounds like it could have come from Accenture \n\n, then they are doing it wrong. And, of course, the passive\n  voice is rarely preferred. Speaking makes this flab noticeable, so we can cut\n  it out.</p><p>In my case I find I constantly (silently) speak the words as I'm writing.</p>","contentLength":1191,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Interviewed by James Lewis at goto Copenhagen","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsMUuOwv7IA","date":1748022480,"author":"Martin Fowler","guid":300,"unread":true,"content":"<p>At goto copenhagen last year, my friend James Lewis <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsMUuOwv7IA\">interviewed\n      me</a> and Goto have just released the video.
