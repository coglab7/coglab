The FAIR Package Manager project is a response to the legal brawl that erupted last year, pitting WordPress co-creator Matthew Mullenweg, his for-profit hosting firm Automattic, and the WordPress Foundation that he controls, against WP Engine, a rival commercial WordPress hosting firm. [...]\n \nThe Linux Foundation says the FAIR Package Manager, a mechanism for distributing open-source WordPress plugins, \"eliminates reliance on any single source for core updates, plugins, themes, and more, unites a fragmented ecosystem by bringing together plugins from any source, and builds security into the supply chain.\" In other words, it can't be weaponized against the WordPress community because it won't be controlled by any one entity. \"The FAIR Package Manager project paves the way for the stability and growth of open source content management, giving contributors and businesses additional options governed by a neutral community,\" said Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation, in a canned press statement. \"We look forward to the growth in community and contributions this important project attracts.\"\n \nThe FAIR Package Manager repo explains the software's purpose more succinctly. The software \"is a decentralized alternative to the central WordPress.org plugin and theme ecosystem, designed to return control to WordPress hosts and developers. It operates as a drop-in WordPress plugin, seamlessly replacing existing centralized services with a federated, open-source infrastructure.\" In addition to providing some measure of stability, the Linux Foundation sees the FAIR Package Manager as advancing WordPress' alignment with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation by reducing automatic browser data transmission and telemetry sent to commercial entities, while also supporting modern security practices and strengthening the open source software supply chain.","contentLength":2142,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Linux User Share Hits a Multi-Year High On Steam For May 2025","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/06/02/2124213/linux-user-share-hits-a-multi-year-high-on-steam-for-may-2025?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1748901600,"author":"BeauHD","guid":281,"unread":true,"content":"Linux user share on Steam rose to 2.69% in May 2025 -- the highest level recorded since at least 2018.

Tools like Apport and systemd-coredump are designed to handle crash reporting and core dumps in Linux systems. \"These race conditions allow a local attacker to exploit a SUID program and gain read access to the resulting core dump,\" Saeed Abbasi, manager of product at Qualys TRU, said... \nRed Hat said CVE-2025-4598 has been rated Moderate in severity owing to the high complexity in pulling an exploit for the vulnerability, noting that the attacker has to first win the race condition and be in possession of an unprivileged local account... Qualys has also developed proof-of-concept code for both vulnerabilities, demonstrating how a local attacker can exploit the coredump of a crashed unix_chkpwd process, which is used to verify the validity of a user's password, to obtain password hashes from the /etc/shadow file. \nAdvisories were also issued by Gentoo, Amazon Linux, and Debian, the article points out. (Though \"It's worth noting that Debian systems aren't susceptible to CVE-2025-4598 by default, since they don't include any core dump handler unless the systemd-coredump package is manually installed.\") \n\nCanonical software security engineer Octavio Galland explains the issue on Canonical's blog. \"If a local attacker manages to induce a crash in a privileged process and quickly replaces it with another one with the same process ID that resides inside a mount and pid namespace, apport will attempt to forward the core dump (which might contain sensitive information belonging to the original, privileged process) into the namespace... In order to successfully carry out the exploit, an attacker must have permissions to create user, mount and pid namespaces with full capabilities.\"\n\nCanonical's security team has released updates for the apport package for all affected Ubuntu releases...

As Phoronix's Michael Larabel reports, \"the hope is for lower memory use, higher performance, dynamic swap allocation and growth, greater extensibility, and other improvements over the existing swap code within the Linux kernel.\" From the report: Engineer Kairui Song with Tencent posted the Swap Table patch series today for implementing the design ideas discussed in recent months by kernel developers. The results are very exciting so let's get straight to it: \"With this series, swap subsystem will have a ~20-30% performance gain from basic sequential swap to heavy workloads, for both 4K and mTHP folios. The idle memory usage is already much lower, the average memory consumption is still the same or will also be even lower (with further works). And this enables many more future optimizations, with better defined swap operations.\" \"The patches also clean-up and address various historical issues with the SWAP subsystem,\" notes Larabel.\n \nContext: In Linux, swap space acts as an overflow for RAM, storing inactive memory pages on disk to free up RAM for active processes. Traditional swap mechanisms are limited in flexibility and performance. The proposed \"Swap Tables\" aim to address these issues by allowing more efficient and dynamic management of swap space, potentially leading to better system responsiveness and resource utilization.","contentLength":1472,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Microsoft Is Open-Sourcing Its Linux Integration Services Automation Image-Testing Service","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/05/14/215254/microsoft-is-open-sourcing-its-linux-integration-services-automation-image-testing-service?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1747262400,"author":"BeauHD","guid":274,"unread":true,"content":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet: Would you believe Microsoft has announced a new Linux distribution service for its Azure cloud service? You should. For many years, the most popular operating system on Azure has not been Windows Server, it's been Linux. Last time I checked, in 2024, Azure Linux Platforms Group Program Manager Jack Aboutboul told me that 60% of Azure Marketplace offerings and more than 60% of virtual machine cores use Linux. Those figures mean it's sensible for Microsoft to make it easier than ever for Linux distributors to release first-class Linux distros on Azure. The tech giant is taking this step, said Andrew Randall, principal manager for the Azure Core Linux product management team, by making \"Azure Image Testing for Linux (AITL) available 'as a service' to distro publishers.\"\n \nATIL is built on Microsoft's Linux Integration Services Automation project (LISA). Microsoft's Linux Systems Group originally developed this initiative to validate Linux OS images. LISA is a Linux quality validation system with two parts: a test framework to drive test execution and a set of test suites to verify Linux distribution quality. LISA is now open-sourced under the MIT License. The system enables continuous testing of Linux images, covering a wide range of scenarios from kernel updates to complex cloud-native workloads. [...] Specifically, the ATIL service is designed to streamline the deployment, testing, and management of Linux images on Azure. The service builds on the company's internal expertise and open-source tools to provide:\n \n- Curated, Azure-optimized, security-hardened Linux images\n- Automated quality assurance and compliance testing for Linux distributions\n- Seamless integration with Azure's cloud-native services and Kubernetes environments \n\n Krum Kashan, Microsoft Azure Linux Platforms Group program manager, said in a statement: \"While numerous testing tools are available for validating Linux kernels, guest OS images, and user space packages across various cloud platforms, finding a comprehensive testing framework that addresses the entire platform stack remains a significant challenge.
