Martin","guid":7,"unread":true,"content":"This study demonstrates that high alcohol concentrations during binge drinking activate a small GABAergic neuronal ensemble in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which subsequently reduces further alcohol consumption. This effect is mediated by the ensemble’s projections to the mediodorsal thalamus.","contentLength":300,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A route for cerebrospinal fluid flow through leptomeningeal arterial–venous overlaps enables macromolecule and fluid shunting","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01977-4","date":1749427200,"author":"Antoine Drieu","guid":6,"unread":true,"content":"The authors describe a mechanism for the clearance of macromolecules from cerebrospinal fluid in which macromolecules traverse from periarterial to perivenous spaces, at sites where intersecting leptomeningeal perivascular (arteriovenous) spaces overlap.","contentLength":254,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Spatial reasoning via recurrent neural dynamics in mouse retrosplenial cortex","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01944-z","date":1749168000,"author":"Mark T.
