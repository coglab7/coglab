Now, however, the economy is facing a risky combination of factors—including rising prices, slowing growth and an acute labor shortage—that is threatening its stability and outlook.</p><p>In a sign that the Kremlin is aware of how fragile the country's economic position currently is, Russia's central bank cut its key interest rate to 20 percent on Friday, down from a two-decade high of 21 percent.</p><p>According to the report released earlier this week and authored by Belousov, GDP growth in Russia slowed down to 1.4 percent in Q1 2025 compared to a year earlier. While inflation is slowing down, it remains very high, at 9.8 percent.</p><p>While slowing investments in machinery and equipment has played into this slowdown, Belousov said that it has been accelerated by \"growing problems in construction,\" with the number of new projects now declining, and falling consumer demand, especially when it comes to non-food products. According to the report, consumer spending has been stagnating since mid-2024.</p><p>The combination of rising inflation and stagnant economic growth could bring the Russian economy into a state of \"stagflation,\" which is usually also characterized by high unemployment. In Russia, according to official data, unemployment is currently low at 2.4 percent.</p><p>Belousov presented a \"countdown\" to a potential crisis in Russia. The report said that a potential downturn of the Russian economy could unfold between Q2 and Q3 2025 as a slowdown in economic growth and falling consumer demand and as a weakening of the ruble between Q3 and Q4 2025.</p><p>This loss in value for the Russian currency would be caused by a dip in trade in the first half of the year and a growth in imports, Belousov said, taking into consideration the impact of President <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump\" data-sys=\"1\">Donald Trump</a>'s tariffs.</p><p>\"It is easy to see that the 'trigger' of a new intensification of the crisis could be another step in tightening the interest rate policy of the Bank of Russia, provoked by the (almost inevitable) weakening of the ruble, an increase in administratively regulated tariffs and a corresponding jump in inflation,\" Belousov wrote.</p><p>The analyst recommends that the country focuses on reducing inflation to avoid the worst possible scenario for the Russian economy, as well as on supporting \"the entry of Russian products into all available external markets\" and stimulating investments in fixed capital.</p><p><strong>The Central Bank of the Russian Federation</strong> said in a statement explaining its decision on Friday: \"Domestic demand continues to outstrip the economy's capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, but Russia is gradually returning to a more balanced growth path.\"</p><p><strong>Russia's central bank's Governor Elvira Nabiullina</strong> said in a press conference on Friday: \"We are close to a scenario of balanced economic growth.\" According to Nabiullina, \"monetary policy will remain tight for a long period.\"</p><p>She added: \"Inflation ultimately eats away at the economy's potential, so our goal is to curb inflation and allow the real sector of the economy to develop.\"</p>","contentLength":3736,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1l6d96q/putin_warned_of_dual_threat_to_russian_economy/"},{"title":"How Will Private Equity Change Big Law?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzAmjJ--QkU","date":1749391250,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":520,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Big law is going through a transformation as private equity sees the investment potential in law firms.

But it was still seen as a win for Merz.</p><p>\"Being sidelined is not necessarily always a bad thing,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, told CNBC on Friday. \"In fact, it might have even helped Merz as the Musk distraction was also deviating attention away from more controversial topics.\"</p><p>It was a high-stakes trip for Merz, who is just a few weeks into his chancellorship, especially given the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/28/trump-vance-and-zelenskyy-clash-at-white-house-ukraine-meeting.html\">treatment</a> other leaders have gotten from Trump in the Oval Office in recent months.</p><p>As such, Merz is unlikely to be disappointed about the outcome — especially given the potential downsides.</p><p>\"Having avoided an escalation in the Oval Office is already an achievement these days,\" Brzeski added.</p></div><div><p>Merz arrived in Washington with a full agenda that ranged from strengthening relations between the U.S. and Germany, to tariffs — which could significantly impact key German industries — as well as U.S. support for Ukraine in its war with Russia and higher NATO defense spending.</p><p>While we don't know what was discussed behind closed doors, Merz was seemingly able to address most of these points with Trump, political strategist Julius van de Laar told CNBC's \"<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-europe/\">Squawk Box Europe</a>\" on Friday.</p></div><div><p>\"I think what Friedrich Merz got across is that he hopes that the U.S. president will continue to support Ukraine,\" he said, noting that the issue had gathered momentum recently given several significant attacks.

And 58% of (working-age) Canadians <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221130/dq221130a-eng.htm\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">have</a> college degrees.”</p><p>Canada also has <a href=\"https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-canada.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">vast energy</a> reserves – an asset that could prove useful to the bloc, which is still struggling <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/europe-will-struggle-wean-itself-off-russian-gas-bousso-2025-05-14/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">to wean itself</a> off Russian gas, he added.</p><p>Since launching his campaign last month, Streit has become the most visible proponent of an unlikely proposition that has been gaining traction since Trump began floating the idea of Canada <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/we-are-canadian-ad-trump\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">as the 51st state</a>.</p><p>In late January, a former foreign minister of Germany, Sigmar Gabriel, called for Canada to be invited into the EU. “They are more European than some European member states anyway,” <a href=\"https://www.thepioneer.de/originals/others/articles/sigmar-gabriel-will-kanada-in-die-eu-aufnehmen\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">he told</a> Germany’s Pioneer Media.</p><p>In March, however, a European spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/canadians-want-join-european-union-will-never-happen-paula-pinho/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">appeared to pour cold water</a> on the suggestion, citing an article in the EU treaty that specifies only European states can apply to join the EU.</p><p>Streit brushed off the technicality, pointing to France’s <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/100/outermost-regions-ors-#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20supports%20the,the%20Canary%20Islands%20(Spain).\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">overseas territories</a>. “Those are also not in Europe, but those islands belong to the European Union,” he said. Cyprus, considered <a href=\"https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/eu-countries/cyprus_en\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">EU territory</a> but located geographically in west Asia, was another example.</p><p>And if one wanted to get technical, Canada was – albeit in a minuscule way – connected geographically to Europe, he said. “Greenland, which belongs to Denmark, shares a border with Canada,” he said, pointing to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/14/canada-denmark-end-decades-long-dispute-barren-rock-arctic-hans-island\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">divide that runs</a> through the uninhabited half-mile square Hans Island.</p><p>In April, Streit <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2025-001336_EN.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">submitted</a> a written question to the European parliament, asking whether the treaty article stipulating that states must be European could be interpreted in a way that could allow for Canadian membership or, barring that, if it could be legally revised. He has yet to receive a response.</p><p>Undaunted, he sent a letter to two EU commissioners calling for a sort of <a href=\"https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/the-voices-of-europe/2025/04/30/a-political-erasmus-for-the-eu-and-canada-building-bridges-across-the-atlantic/\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">political Erasmus</a> to be launched between the bloc and Canada. What he envisions is a professional exchange programme that would allow EU officials to better grasp the nuances of Canadian federalism and Canadians to get a sense of the workings of European institutions.</p><p>“It would serve as both a symbolic and practical step toward deeper integration,” he said, one that could build on existing ties such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/eu-canada-sign-ceta-free-trade-deal-trudeau-juncker\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">EU-Canada trade deal</a> and Canada’s <a href=\"https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/ised/en/horizon-europe\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">participation</a> in the EU’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/05/british-scientists-eu-horizon-research-funding-programme\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">flagship</a> science research programme, Horizon.</p><p>Since launching the campaign, he’s been in constant contact with Canadians; meeting twice with one of Canada’s high-ranking envoys to the EU and meeting with a Brussels-based association that promotes Canada-EU trade.</p><p>As news spreads of his efforts, his office has received a handful of emails of support. Some have offered up their own thoughts on how to skirt around Canada’s geographic location; one recent email laid out what the writer described as a “killer argument”, pointing out that as part of the Commonwealth Canada was tied to the UK and, by extension, Europe.</p><p>Streit took it one step further. “And who is the head of Canada?” he asked, pointing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/canada-mark-carney-king-charles\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">King Charles.</a> “And he’s a European.”</p><p>Streit said he was well aware that, for all his efforts, the idea may prove to be impossible. Even so, he hoped that the moment could be seized on to at least hammer out the kind of deep ties the bloc has with countries such as Norway or Switzerland.</p><p>“Sometimes in history, the windows of opportunity open and close again,” he said. “And sometimes, the windows of opportunity are open only for a brief moment.”</p>","contentLength":4871,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1l667w3/canada_wont_become_the_51st_us_state_but_could_it/"},{"title":"France opens ‘complicity in genocide’ probes against French-Israelis over blocked Gaza aid","url":"https://www.timesofisrael.com/france-opens-complicity-in-genocide-probes-over-blocked-gaza-aid/","date":1749359562,"author":"/u/soalone34","guid":435,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1l64cwz/france_opens_complicity_in_genocide_probes/"},{"title":"Could this fungus help tackle the plastic waste crisis?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wANgRTkHVuo","date":1749358863,"author":"Reuters","guid":552,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A newly isolated marine-derived fungus that can degrade polypropylene, discovered by Australian researchers, could represent a breakthrough in the battle against plastic waste.\n\n#plastic #waste #environment #fungus #research #science</article>","contentLength":233,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/wANgRTkHVuo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Public and Private Meet at the Africa CEO Forum","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNFYq85FBXY","date":1749358837,"author":"Bloomberg Television","guid":517,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The Africa CEO Forum 2025 took place in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and saw 2,000 business leaders, investors and policy makers take part in two days of conferences, debates and high-level meetings dedicated to highlighting the driving role of the private sector in the development of the continent.
