However, such overt reporting has limitations, leading to research on physiological signals that disclose consciousness without relying on overt behaviour. In this Review, Kronemer, Bandettini and Gonzalez-Castillo explore such covert measures of consciousness in humans.","contentLength":387,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Neuroferroptosis in health and diseases","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00930-5","date":1747612800,"author":"Scott Ayton","guid":11,"unread":true,"content":"The brainâ€™s high lipid content, iron levels and oxygen metabolism uniquely predispose it to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death.
