Mike &amp; Warren here from HyperDX (now part of ClickHouse)! We’ve been building ClickStack, an open source observability stack that helps you collect, centralize, search/viz/alert on your telemetry (logs, metrics, traces) in just a few minutes - all powered by ClickHouse (Apache2) for storage, HyperDX (MIT) for visualization and OpenTelemetry (Apache2) for ingestion.</p><p>ClickStack makes it really easy to instrument your application so you can go from bug reports of “my checkout didn’t go through” to a session replay of the user, backend API calls, to DB queries and infrastructure metrics related to that specific request in a single view.</p><p>For those that might be migrating from Very Expensive Observability Vendor (TM) to something open source, more performant, and doesn’t require extensive culling of retention limits and sampling rates - ClickStack gives a batteries-included way of starting that migration journey.</p><p>For those that aren’t familiar with ClickHouse, it’s a high performance database that has already been used by companies such as Anthropic, Cloudflare, and DoorDash to power their core observability at scale due to its flexibility, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. However, this required teams to dedicate engineers to building a custom observability stack, where it’s difficult to not only get their telemetry data easily into ClickHouse but also struggling without a native UI experience.</p><p>That’s why we’re building ClickStack - we wanted to bundle an easy way to get started ingesting your telemetry data whether it’s logs &amp; traces from Node.js or Ruby to metrics from Kubernetes or your bare metal infrastructure. Just as important we wanted our users to enjoy a visualization experience that allowed users to quickly search using a familiar lucene-like search syntax (similar to what you’d use in Google!). We recognise though, that a SQL mode is needed for the most complex of queries. We've also added high cardinality outlier analysis by charting the delta between outlier and inlier events - which we've found really helpful in narrowing down causes of regressions/anomalies in our traces as well as log patterns to condense down clusters of similar logs.</p><p>We’re really excited about the roadmap ahead in terms of improving ClickStack as a product and the ClickHouse core database to improve observability. Would love to hear everyone’s feedback and what they think!</p>","contentLength":2429,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44194082"},{"title":"Show HN: Container Use for Agents","url":"https://github.com/dagger/container-use","date":1749145467,"author":"aluzzardi","guid":185,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44193933"},{"title":"Show HN: I made a 3D SVG Renderer that projects textures without rasterization","url":"https://seve.blog/p/i-made-a-3d-svg-renderer-that-projects","date":1749089133,"author":"seveibar","guid":183,"unread":true,"content":"<p>SVGs don’t support perspective transforms like CSS (or at least they’re not guaranteed to work in image viewers), so we need a way to simulate this perspective transformation without creating a massive SVG.

Here are some ideas I mulled over that could achieve a good result:</p><ul><li><p>Redraw the image with the distortion. This is potentially expensive and means that we can’t use SVGs as the images without converting them to bitmaps. It also means that things might look “fuzzy”</p></li><li><p>Ray trace everything! By projecting a ray to compute each pixel for the image, I could get a very conventional 3d renderer. This doesn’t achieve my goal of lightweight SVGs though</p></li><li><p>Subdivide the image and project each subdivision in the most locally-correct affine transformation. Use projected polygon clip paths to cut off the edges of regions.</p></li></ul><p>I was really curious how the last bullet point could work, and I could think of no other ideas that didn’t require rasterization. So with OpenAI O3’s help I implemented it into the vanilla Typescript 3D renderer.

We've just released an open-source React bundler plugin that makes apps multilingual—at build time, without modifying the code.</p><p>React app localization typically requires implementing i18n frameworks, extracting text to JSON files, and wrapping components in translation tags - essentially rewriting your entire codebase before you can even start translating.</p><p>Our React bundler plugin eliminates this friction entirely.\nYou add it to an existing React app, specify which languages you want, and it automatically makes your app multilingual without touching a single line of your component code.</p><p>Last year, a dev from our Twitter community told us: \"I don't want to wrap every React component with `</p><p>Our first reaction was \"That's not how i18n works in React.\" But a couple hours later, we found ourselves deep in a technical rabbit hole, wondering what if that actually was possible?</p><p>That question led us to build the \"localization compiler\" - a middleware for React that plugs into the codebase, processes the Abstract Syntax Tree of the React code, deterministically locates translatable elements, feeds every context boundary into LLMs, and bakes the translations back into the build, making UI multilingual in seconds.</p><p>Everything happens locally during build time, keeping the React project as the source of truth. No code modifications, no extraction, and no maintenance of separate translation files are needed, however, overrides are possible via data-lingo-* attributes.</p>\n  );\n}\n```<p>The biggest challenge was making our compiler compatible with Hot Module Replacement. This allows developers to code in English while instantly seeing the UI in Spanish or Japanese, which is invaluable for catching layout issues caused by text expansion or contraction in different languages that take more/less space on the screen.</p><p>For performance, we implemented aggressive caching that stores AST analysis results between runs and only reprocesses components that have changed. Incremental builds stay fast even on large codebases, since at any point in time as a dev, you update only a limited number of components, and we heavily parallelized LLM calls.</p><p>This approach was technically possible before LLMs, but practically useless, since for precise translations you'd still need human translators familiar with the product domain.
