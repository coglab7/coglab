Mutations in human leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments requires LRRK2’s kinase to be in the active-like conformation. However, whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain is in the inactive conformation and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase active site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we show that full-length human LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments. Finally, the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are shorter and less regular, suggesting they are less stable.</article>","contentLength":1652,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dual-format attentional template during preparation in human visual cortex","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/103425","date":1761696000,"author":"Yilin Chen","guid":681,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Goal-directed attention relies on forming internal templates of key information relevant for guiding behavior, particularly when preparing for upcoming sensory inputs. However, evidence on how these attentional templates are represented during preparation remains controversial. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging with an orientation cueing task to isolate preparatory activity from stimulus-evoked responses. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found decodable information about the to-be-attended orientation during preparation; yet preparatory activity patterns were different from those evoked when actual orientations were perceived. When perturbing the neural activity by means of a visual impulse (‘pinging’ technique), the preparatory activity patterns in visual cortex resembled those associated with perceiving these orientations. The observed differential patterns with and without the impulse perturbation suggest a predominantly non-sensory format and a latent, sensory-like format of representation during preparation. Furthermore, the emergence of the sensory-like template coincided with enhanced information connectivity between V1 and frontoparietal areas and was associated with improved behavioral performance. By engaging this dual-format mechanism during preparation, the brain is able to encode both abstract, non-sensory information and more detailed, sensory information, potentially providing advantages for adaptive attentional control. For example, consistent with recent theories of visual search, a predominantly non-sensory template can support the initial guidance and a latent sensory-like format can support prospective stimulus processing.</article>","contentLength":1702,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Axonal injury signaling is restrained by a spared synaptic branch","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/104896","date":1761696000,"author":"Ye Li","guid":682,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The intrinsic ability of injured neurons to degenerate and regenerate their axons facilitates nervous system repair; however, this ability is not engaged in all neurons and injury locations. Here, we investigate the regulation of a conserved axonal injury response pathway with respect to the location of damage in branched motoneuron (MN) axons in  larvae. The dileucine zipper kinase (DLK; also known as MAP3K12 in mammals and Wallenda (Wnd) in ) is a key regulator of diverse responses to axonal injury. In three different populations of MNs, we observed the same striking result that Wnd/DLK signaling becomes activated only in response to injuries that remove all synaptic terminals. Injuries that spared even a small part of a synaptic terminal were insufficient to activate Wnd/DLK signaling, despite the presence of extensive axonal degeneration. The regulation of injury-induced Wnd/DLK signaling occurs independently of its previously known regulator, the Hiw/PHR ubiquitin ligase. We propose that Wnd/DLK signaling regulation is linked to the trafficking of a synapse-to-nucleus axonal cargo and that this mechanism enables neurons to respond to impairments in synaptic connectivity.</article>","contentLength":1194,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Nocebo effects are stronger and more persistent than placebo effects in healthy individuals","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/105753","date":1761609600,"author":"Ulrike Bingel","guid":678,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Placebo and nocebo effects illustrate the profound influence of cognitive-affective processes on symptom perception and treatment outcomes, with the potential to significantly alter responses to medical interventions. Despite their clinical relevance, the question of how placebo and nocebo effects differ in strength and duration remains largely unexplored. Using a within-subject design in 104 healthy individuals, we investigated and directly compared the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain. Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a 1-week follow-up. The study was preregistered in the German Clinical Trials Register (registration number: DRKS00029228). Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on days 1 and 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days. Sustained effects after 1 week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1. Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy. These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.</article>","contentLength":1386,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Newly trained navigation and verbal memory skills in humans elicit changes in task-related networks but not brain structure","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/106873","date":1761609600,"author":"Zachary Boogaart","guid":679,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Training cognitive skills, such as remembering a list of words or navigating a new city, has important implications for everyday life.

Here, we show that blood flow promotes the migration of new olfactory-bulb neurons in the adult mammalian brain. Neuronal migration is facilitated by blood flow, leading to accumulation of new neurons near blood vessels with abundant blood flow. Blood flow inhibition attenuates blood vessel-guided neuronal migration, suggesting that blood contains factors beneficial to neuronal migration. We found that ghrelin, which is increased in blood by hunger, directly influences neuronal migration. Ghrelin signaling promotes somal translocation by activating actin cytoskeleton contraction at the rear of the cell soma. New neurons mature in the olfactory bulb and contribute to the olfactory function for sensing odorants from food. Finally, we show that neuronal migration is increased by calorie restriction, and that ghrelin signaling is involved in the process. This study suggests that blood flow promotes neuronal migration through blood-derived ghrelin signaling in the adult brain, which could be one of the mechanisms that improves the olfactory function for food-seeking behavior during starvation.</article>","contentLength":1239,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Tonotopy is not preserved in a descending stage of auditory cortex","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/99989","date":1761523200,"author":"Yun Zhang","guid":677,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Previous studies based on layer specificity suggest that ascending signals from the thalamus to the sensory neocortex preserve spatially organized information, but it remains unknown whether sensory information descending from sensory neocortex to the thalamus also maintains such spatial organization pattern. By focusing on projection specificity, we mapped the tone response properties of two groups of cortical neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1), based on the relationship between their specific connections to other regions and their function in ascending (thalamocortical recipient [TR] neurons) or descending (corticothalamic [CT] neurons) auditory information. A clear tonotopic gradient was observed among TR neurons, but not CT neurons. Additionally, CT neurons exhibited markedly higher heterogeneity in their frequency tuning and had broader bandwidth than TR neurons. These results reveal that the information flow descending from A1 to the thalamus via CT neurons is not arranged tonotopically, suggesting that the descending information flow possibly contributes to higher-order feedback processing of diverse auditory inputs.</article>","contentLength":1150,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing for opening the blood-brain barrier through specific mode electroacupuncture stimulation","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/107938","date":1761264000,"author":"Zixin Pan","guid":676,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) interferes with the treatment of central nervous system disorders owing to the complexity of its structure and restrictive function.

Among these, spatiotemporal complexity after a perturbation has recently emerged as a robust metric to infer levels of consciousness. Perturbation paradigms remain, however, difficult to perform routinely. To discover alternative paradigms and metrics, we systematically explore brain stimulation and resting-state activity in a whole-brain model. We find that perturbational complexity only occurs when the brain model operates within a specific dynamical regime, in which spontaneous activity produces a large degree of functional network reorganizations referred to as being fluid. The regime of high brain fluidity is characterized by a small battery of metrics drawn from dynamical systems theory and predicts the impact of consciousness-altering drugs (Xenon, Propofol, and Ketamine). We validate the predictions in a cohort of 15 subjects at various stages of consciousness and demonstrate their agreement with previously reported perturbational complexity, but in a more accessible paradigm. Beyond the facilitation in clinical use, the metrics highlight complexity properties of brain dynamics in support of the emergence of consciousness.</article>","contentLength":1244,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Blood pressure variability compromises vascular function in middle-aged mice","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/104082","date":1761091200,"author":"Weston Bush","guid":672,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Blood pressure variability (BPV) has emerged as a significant risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, independent of alterations in average blood pressure (BP).

Radio telemetry confirmed that 24 hr BP averages in BPV mice remained comparable to controls, demonstrating BPV in the absence of hypertension. Chronic (20–25 days) BPV resulted in a blunted bradycardic response and cognitive deficits. Two-photon imaging revealed heightened pressure-evoked constrictions (myogenic response) in parenchymal arterioles of BPV mice. While sensory stimulus-evoked dilations (neurovascular coupling) were amplified at higher BP levels in control mice, this pressure-dependent effect was abolished in BPV mice. Our findings indicate that chronic BP fluctuations impair vascular function within the neurovascular complex and contribute to cognitive decline, emphasizing BPV as a critical factor in brain health.</article>","contentLength":1128,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Sequential temporal anticipation characterized by neural power modulation and in recurrent neural networks","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/99383","date":1761091200,"author":"Xiangbin Teng","guid":673,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Relevant prospective moments arise intermittently, while most of the time is filled with irrelevant events, or noise, that constantly bombard our sensory systems. Thus, anticipating a few key moments necessitates disregarding what lies between the present and the future – the noise. Here, through examining how the brain and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) anticipate a sequence of prospective moments without relying on any external timing cues, we provided a reinterpretation of temporal anticipation. We first designed a ‘premembering’ task, where we marked three temporal locations in white noise and asked human listeners to detect a tone at one of these points. Using power modulation analyses, we investigated the memory-guided anticipatory processes in trials involving only flat noise. Our research revealed a unique neural-power modulation pattern for sequential temporal anticipation: neural power within the alpha-beta band range fluctuates over time, accurately identifying the marked locations on a sub-second scale and correlating with tone detection performance. To understand the functional roles of these neural modulations, we utilized RNNs optimized for the behavioral task. The hidden dynamics of the RNNs mirrored the neural modulations, and additional analyses and perturbations on the RNNs indicated that the neural power modulations in the alpha-beta band resulted from selective suppression of irrelevant noise periods and heightened sensitivity to anticipated temporal locations. Our behavioral, neural, and modeling findings collectively indicate that sequential temporal anticipation involves a process of dynamic gain control: anticipating a few significant moments involves actively disregarding irrelevant events that frequently occur.</article>","contentLength":1775,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Longitudinal assessment of DREADD expression and efficacy in the monkey brain","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/105815","date":1761091200,"author":"Yukiko Hori","guid":674,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) offer a powerful means for reversible control of neuronal activity through systemic administration of inert actuators.

While directional tuning in the arm region of the sensorimotor cortex during reaching tasks is well studied, little is known about how three-dimensional (3D) tongue direction is encoded in the orofacial sensorimotor cortex (OSMCx) during natural behaviors. Understanding this neural representation has important implications for rehabilitating individuals with orolingual dysfunctions. This study examines the directional tuning and population dynamics in OSMCx during naturalistic feeding and drinking, and how these are affected by sensory loss. Using biplanar video-radiography, we tracked implanted tongue markers in behaving rhesus macaques () and simultaneously recorded 3D positional data with spiking activity from chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary motor (MIo) and somatosensory (SIo) areas of the orofacial cortex. In some sessions, tasks were preceded by bilateral nerve block injections to the sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve. Modulation to 3D tongue direction during feeding and drinking was found in most MIo and SIo neurons. Directional information at both individual and population levels was higher in feeding and was more robust in MIo. Following sensory loss, alterations in tongue kinematics were accompanied by changes in directional information in MIo and SIo, manifesting as modifications in both individual neuron tuning characteristics and the broader dynamics of population-level neural activity. This study advances our understanding of single-neuron and population activity in OSMCx and their potential contributions to the sensorimotor control of complex naturalistic tongue movements. By extending current knowledge of orofacial control to 3D tongue movements, our findings demonstrate the specificity and adaptability of population activity in MIo and SIo in response to different behavioral contexts, providing important insights for understanding neural mechanisms underlying skilled tongue control.</article>","contentLength":2125,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How hunger guides new brain cells to their destination","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/109178","date":1760918400,"author":"Laurent Nguyen","guid":666,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Blood flow and a hormone called ghrelin help new neurons travel to where they are meant to be in the brain of adult mice.</article>","contentLength":121,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The unique synaptic circuitry of specialized olfactory glomeruli in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/88824","date":1760918400,"author":"Thomas Pertsch","guid":667,"unread":true,"content":"<article>In the  olfactory system, most odorants are encoded in the antennal lobe in a combinatory way, activating several glomerular circuits.

Our findings advance the understanding of pulvinar anatomy and function, offering an exploratory framework to investigate the role of this structure in both health and disease.</article>","contentLength":1595,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Age and learning shapes sound representations in auditory cortex during adolescence","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/106387","date":1760313600,"author":"Shaul Druckmann","guid":660,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened plasticity. Yet, how ongoing development affects sensory processing and cognitive function is unclear. We investigated how adolescent (postnatal day 20–42) and adult (postnatal day 60–82) mice differ in performance on a pure tone Go/No-Go auditory discrimination task of varying difficulty. Using dense electrophysiological recordings, we measured spiking activity at single neuron resolution in the auditory cortex while mice were engaged in the task. As compared to adults, adolescent mice showed lower auditory discrimination performance in a difficult task. This difference in performance was due to higher response variability and weaker cognitive control expressed as higher lick bias. Adolescent and adult neuronal responses differed only slightly in representations of pure tones when measured outside the context of learning and the task. However, cortical representations after learning within the context of the task were markedly different. We found differences in stimulus- and choice-related activity at the single neuron level representations, as well as lower population-level decoding of the difficult task in adolescents. Overall, cortical decoding in adolescents was lower and slower, especially for difficult sound discrimination, reflecting immature cortical representations of sounds and choices. Notably, we found age-related differences, which were more pronounced after learning, reflecting the combined impact of age and learning. Our findings highlight distinct neurophysiological and behavioral profiles in adolescence, underscoring the ongoing development of cognitive control mechanisms and cortical plasticity during this sensitive developmental period.</article>","contentLength":1754,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Transcranial direct current stimulation modulates primate brain dynamics across states of consciousness","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/101688","date":1760313600,"author":"Rodrigo Cofre","guid":661,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The resting primate brain is traversed by spontaneous functional connectivity patterns that show striking differences between conscious and unconscious states. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique, can improve signs of consciousness in disorders of consciousness (DOCs); however, can it influence both conscious and unconscious dynamic functional connectivity? We investigated the modulatory effect of prefrontal cortex (PFC) tDCS on brain dynamics in awake and anesthetized non-human primates using functional MRI. In awake macaques receiving either anodal or cathodal tDCS, we found that cathodal stimulation robustly disrupted the repertoire of functional connectivity patterns, increased structure–function correlation (SFC), decreased Shannon entropy, and favored transitions toward anatomically based patterns. Under deep sedation, anodal tDCS significantly altered brain pattern distribution and reduced SFC. The prefrontal stimulation also modified dynamic connectivity arrangements typically associated with consciousness and unconsciousness. Our findings offer compelling evidence that PFC tDCS induces striking modifications in the fMRI-based dynamic organization of the brain across different states of consciousness. This study contributes to an enhanced understanding of tDCS neuromodulation mechanisms and has important clinical implications for DOCs.</article>","contentLength":1420,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Probing the staying power of chemogenetics","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/109193","date":1760313600,"author":"Maria Puchik","guid":662,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A study that monitored the expression and function of designer receptors called DREADDs in macaque monkeys for a period of three years demonstrates that they are effective in long-term studies of nonhuman primates.</article>","contentLength":214,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Chronic stress impairs autoinhibition in neurons of the locus coeruleus to increase asparagine endopeptidase activity","url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/106362","date":1759968000,"author":"Youngnam Kang","guid":657,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Impairments of locus coeruleus (LC) are implicated in anxiety/depression and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Increases in cytosolic noradrenaline (NA) concentration and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) activity initiate the LC impairment through production of NA metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), by MAO-A. However, how NA accumulates in soma/dendritic cytosol of LC neurons has never been addressed despite the fact that NA is virtually absent in cytosol while NA is produced exclusively in cytoplasmic vesicles from dopamine by dopamine-β-hydroxylase. Since reuptake of autocrine-released NA following spike activity is the major source of NA accumulation, we investigated whether and how chronic stress can increase the spike activity accompanied by NA autocrine. Overexcitation of LC neurons is normally prevented by the autoinhibition mediated by activation of α2A-adrenergic receptor (AR)-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium-current (GIRK-I) with autocrine-released NA. Patch-clamp study revealed that NA-induced GIRK-I in LC neurons was decreased in chronic restraint stress (RS) mice, while a similar decrease was gradually caused by repeated excitation. Chronic RS caused internalization of α2A-ARs expressed in cell membrane in LC neurons and decreased protein/mRNA levels of α2A-ARs/GIRKs in membrane fraction. Subsequently, chronic RS increased the protein levels of MAO-A, DOPEGAL-induced asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), and tau N368. These results suggest that chronic RS-induced overexcitation due to the internalization of α2A-ARs/GIRK is accompanied by [Ca] increases, subsequently increasing Ca-dependent MAO-A activity and NA autocrine. Thus, it is likely that internalization of α2A-AR increased cytosolic NA, as reflected in AEP increases, by facilitating reuptake of autocrine-released NA. The suppression of α2A-AR internalization may have a translational potential for anxiety/AD treatment.</article>","contentLength":1938,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["general","cognitive-neuroscience"]}
