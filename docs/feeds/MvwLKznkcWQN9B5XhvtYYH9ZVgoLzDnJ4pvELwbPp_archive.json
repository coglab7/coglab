In this Perspective, Mahmoodi and Rushworth examine the computations required to navigate the social lives of human and non-human primates, arguing how shared neural mechanisms carrying out similar computations in non-social contexts indicate computational rather than contextual specialization in the ‘social brain’.","contentLength":470,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["cognitive-neuroscience","review"]}
