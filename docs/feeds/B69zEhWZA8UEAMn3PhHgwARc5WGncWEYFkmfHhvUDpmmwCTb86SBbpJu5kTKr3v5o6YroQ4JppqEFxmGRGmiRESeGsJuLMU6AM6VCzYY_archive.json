Its goal is to make Kafka a first-class citizen in the Kubernetes ecosystem, easing the burden of managing complex distributed messaging systems. It provides Kubernetes-native APIs and operators to automate the entire Kafka lifecycle, including cluster provisioning, configuration, scaling, updates, and monitoring. Strimzi enables organizations to run Kafka reliably in cloud-native environments by integrating tightly with Kubernetes tools and practices, such as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), persistent storage, and role-based access control (RBAC).\n\nJoin Ambassador Arsh Sharma on Thursday, June 5 as he dives in to exploring Strimzi with you!</article>","contentLength":759,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/wFtatbfgzBM?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Salt stack vs rest of the world","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEEK9Uw8_II","date":1749099662,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":409,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

It streamlines patient data filtering and generates personalized communication. Attendees will gain insight into the architecture of the agentic framework, the OpenAI compatible API and models hosted on cloud servers, and the front-end elements with Streamlit and Hugging Face Spaces.
