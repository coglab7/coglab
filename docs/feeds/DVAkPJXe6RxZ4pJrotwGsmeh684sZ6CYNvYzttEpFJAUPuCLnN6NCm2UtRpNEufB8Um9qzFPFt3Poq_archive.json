While conventional group-level analyses identify diverse structural alterations, they obscure clinically relevant individual differences. We employed heterogeneity through discriminant analysis (HYDRA) clustering to decompose morphometric inverse divergence (MIND) network patterns into distinct neuroanatomical subtypes and examined their molecular underpinnings. We analyzed MIND network data from 240 Japanese individuals with MDD and 367 healthy controls using unsupervised clustering. Subtype-specific alterations were mapped onto neurotransmitter receptor density distributions, and transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas were integrated using partial least squares regression. Two neuroanatomically distinct subtypes emerged. Subtype 1 ( = 78) exhibited widespread increases in MIND strength across all Yeo networks, with predominant serotonergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic associations. Gene expression analysis revealed SST and CUX2 correlations, with enrichment for metal ion homeostasis and circadian rhythm pathways. Subtype 2 ( = 162) showed reduced MIND strength in dorsal attention, somatomotor, frontoparietal, limbic, and default networks, with glutamatergic, cannabinoid, and dopaminergic dysfunction. This subtype demonstrated negative CRH correlations and enrichment for glutamatergic signaling and calcium/cAMP-mediated processes. Our findings demonstrate systematic decomposition of MDD heterogeneity into distinct neuroanatomical subtypes with unique molecular signatures. The identification of subtype-specific neurotransmitter profiles and transcriptomic architectures provides mechanistic insights into MDD heterogeneity, offering potential for biomarker-guided treatment selection and personalized therapeutic approaches.</p>","contentLength":2008,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Topographic Variation in Human Neurotransmitter Receptor Densities Explains Differences in Intracranial EEG Spectra","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70393?af=R","date":1761920132,"author":"U.

Both neurotransmitter receptor expression and neuronal population dynamics show a remarkable regional variability across the human cortex. We leverage this functional specialisation to characterise the relationship between receptor architectonics and electrophysiological signals. Using dynamic causal modelling (DCM), we fitted neural mass models to a normative set of intracranial EEG data. Subsequently, Bayesian model comparison helped to evaluate whether models improved when equipped with constraints on synaptic connectivity, based on regional neurotransmitter receptor densities. The results show that dynamic causal models generated region-specific intracranial EEG spectra accurately. Incorporating prior information on normative receptor distributions further improved model evidence, indicating that regional variation in receptor density explains variations in synaptic connectivity and ensuing cortical population dynamics. The output is a cortical atlas of neurobiologically informed intracortical synaptic connectivity parameters. These can serve as empirical priors in future, patient-specific models. In summary, we show that molecular cortical characteristics—that is, receptor densities—enrich and inform generative, biophysically plausible models of coupled neuronal populations. This work helps to explain regional variations in human electrophysiology, provides a methodological foundation to integrate multimodal data, and serves as a normative resource for future DCM studies of electrophysiology.</p>","contentLength":2006,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for White Matter Shape Prediction in Diffusion MRI Tractography","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70396?af=R","date":1761916499,"author":"Yui Lo,  Yuqian Chen,  Dongnan Liu,  Leo Zekelman,  Jarrett Rushmore,  Yogesh Rathi,  Nikos Makris,  Alexandra J.

We evaluate our multimodal framework on multiple datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>Recently, shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. To address these limitations, we introduce Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that integrates geometric streamline features (as point clouds) with scalar data descriptors (as tabular data) from tractography to predict 10 white matter tractography shape measures. We propose a Siamese architecture in which each subnetwork incorporates a dual-encoder design, enabling each encoder to learn modality-specific representations. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets: the Human Connectome Project minimally preprocessed young adults (HCP-YA) dataset and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Tract2Shape is trained and tested on the HCP-YA dataset, with performance compared against state-of-the-art models. To assess robustness and generalization, we further evaluate the model on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models across all 10 shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's  and the lowest normalized mean squared error (nMSE) on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA benefit performance. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's  and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. In comparison with traditional voxel-representation-based shape computation, Tract2Shape achieves a 99.2% improvement in efficiency (&lt; 0.1 s per subject). Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets.

However, little is known about the extent to which MRI processing pipelines influence results. Using 39,655 T1-weighted MRI scans from the UK Biobank, we systematically compared five widely used gray-matter representations derived from three major software packages: FSL (volume-based), CAT12/SPM (volume- and surface-based), and FreeSurfer (cortical and subcortical surface-based). We assessed their impact on morphometricity (trait variance explained by brain features), susceptibility to imaging confounders, false positives, association findings, and prediction accuracy across 29 diverse traits, including lifestyle, metabolic, and disease-related variables. We found that all pipelines were sensitive to imaging confounders such as head motion, brain position, and signal-to-noise ratio, and many produced non-normal voxel or vertex distributions. FSL and FreeSurfer generally yielded higher morphometricity estimates, but each captured partially unique signals, leading to inconsistencies in brain regions identified across methods. Volume-based approaches tended to outperform surface-based ones, detecting more significant clusters, achieving higher replication rates, and producing stronger predictive performance. Small clusters (single voxels or vertices) were less reliable, suggesting caution in their interpretation. Among all methods, FSLVBM emerged as the most consistent all-rounder, maximizing morphometricity, replicability, and predictive accuracy. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of commonly used processing pipelines, offering benchmarks to guide researchers in method selection. They further suggest that combining multiple pipelines may improve brain-based prediction by leveraging unique, complementary signals, and that careful treatment of imaging confounders is essential for robust large-scale neuroimaging analyses.</p>","contentLength":2435,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Phase‐Specific Contributions and Interactions of the Left and Right Posterior Middle Temporal Gyri in Vocal Feedback Control: Evidence From Dual‐Site TMS","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70390?af=R","date":1761741735,"author":"Qingqing Liu,  Jiating Li,  Shuzhi Zhao,  Mingyun Chen,  Xin Huang,  Dongxu Liu,  Jingting Li,  Xiuqin Wu,  Yongxue Li,  Xi Chen,  Peng Liu,  Guangyan Dai,  Hanjun Liu","guid":691,"unread":true,"content":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a31a7bb7-1be1-476c-8b36-edf48a7ab28d/hbm70390-toc-0001-m.png\" alt=\"Phase-Specific Contributions and Interactions of the Left and Right Posterior Middle Temporal Gyri in Vocal Feedback Control: Evidence From Dual-Site TMS\"><p>This study demonstrates the causal roles of the left and right posterior middle temporal gyri in vocal feedback control and reveals a phase-specific interhemispheric mechanism that transitions from coordinated error detection to independent correction, offering novel neuromodulation strategies for speech rehabilitation.</p><p>The posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) has been implicated in sensorimotor control of speech production, but the causality underlying this relationship remains largely unclear. The present event-related potential study employed dual-site continuous theta burst stimulation (c-TBS) over the left and right pMTGs concurrently to investigate their causal roles and interhemispheric interactions in vocal feedback control. Following bilateral c-TBS, unilateral c-TBS paired with contralateral sham stimulation, or bilateral sham stimulation over the left and right pMTGs, 24 healthy young adults produced sustained vocalizations while exposed to unexpected pitch perturbations (±200 cents) in auditory feedback. Compared to sham stimulation, c-TBS over the left, right, or bilateral pMTG significantly reduced the magnitudes and shortened the latencies of vocal compensations, paralleled by enhanced P2 responses that received contributions from distinct fronto-tempo-parietal networks. In contrast, reduced N1 responses were observed only following bilateral pMTG stimulation. Our findings not only provide the first causal evidence for bilateral pMTG involvement in vocal feedback control but also reveal a phase-specific interhemispheric interaction, transitioning from bilateral coordination during early error detection to unilateral sufficiency during later motor correction.

Emotion regulation strategies that aim to reduce negative experiences and enhance positive ones often face the dilemma of prioritizing one outcome at the expense of the other. Modest individuals, characterized by the low self-focus perspective, may demonstrate advantages in managing emotional experiences derived from self-relevant social feedback. In this study, participants with high and low levels of modesty were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while receiving social feedback of different valences and congruencies, with feedback indicating whether others liked participants. Results showed that highly modest individuals were less likely to use expressive suppression as an emotion regulation strategy. At the neural level, trait modesty modulated brain activity in the inferior parietal lobe and left superior temporal gyrus under unexpected conditions compared to expected conditions, as well as in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex under acceptance versus rejection conditions. Psychophysiological interaction analysis and brain-behavior correlation analyses further explored the mechanisms of modesty, helping individuals reduce negative experiences and enhance positive experiences.

Cerebral amyloidosis precedes synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration markers, followed by the onset of AD-related cognitive impairment. To improve early AD-biomarker detection accuracy, patient data is, however, often collected via invasive procedures such as a lumbar puncture or intravenous injection of active radiopharmaceuticals. This coupled health risk is small yet significant and can be avoided by generating equally predictive or superior AD-risk staging proxy biomarkers derived from noninvasive neuroimaging modalities. In addition, using neuroimaging can provide richer insights into regional distributions of brain biomarkers of AD. Motivated by that, here we train neural networks to optimally generate latent structural MRI (sMRI) representations as proxies for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker status on multiple classification and prediction contexts, an approach that we demonstrate has the potential to be clinically useful in screening and diagnosing AD and predicting AD progression. We found that the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, posterior and middle cingulate gyrus, middle and inferior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobe regions revealed maximum attribution, thereby implying the highest prognostic value for AD risk.

Prior evidence implicates prior concussion and RHI in reduced cortical thickness or volume in temporal and frontal regions, with results largely restricted to older retired contact sport athletes. Fewer studies have investigated similar associations in younger athletes or applied approaches to capture more subtle differences in gray matter earlier in the lifespan. The current study assessed the association of concussion and RHI with cortical macrostructure (cortical thickness, cortical surface area), and cortical microstructure (cortical mean diffusivity), the latter of which has been suggested to be an earlier marker of gray matter abnormalities in neurodegenerative diseases. A total of 207 otherwise healthy collegiate-aged athletes completed semistructured interviews for concussion and sport participation history, as well as a magnetic resonance imaging session including anatomical and diffusion imaging ( = 205 with available diffusion data). Cortical surface area and cortical thickness were estimated using FreeSurfer; cortical mean diffusivity was calculated with correction for partial volume. Bayesian multilevel modeling was conducted on regions of interest derived from Desikan–Killiany Atlas parcellations to determine the association of the number of prior concussions and RHI (included in the same models) with each metric, controlling for sex, age, and intracranial volume (area only). There was strong evidence for a positive association between the number of prior concussions and cortical mean diffusivity throughout most of the cortex. In addition, there was strong evidence for a positive association of the number of prior concussions with cortical surface area across several regions. For cortical thickness, there was strong evidence of inverse associations between the number of prior concussions and anterior and medial temporal cortical regions only. In contrast, only weak to no evidence of associations between years of contact sport exposure, a proxy for RHI, and any cortical surface metric was observed. These results demonstrate that cortical diffusivity may represent a more sensitive metric of subtle, early structural changes associated with repetitive neurotrauma, and highlight the importance of efforts to reduce concussion risk in sport.</p>","contentLength":2820,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"A Toaster in the Bathroom: Neural Correlates of Semantic Construction During Episodic Memory Recall","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70389?af=R","date":1761396220,"author":"Carina Zoellner,  Rebekka Heinen,  Nicole Klein,  Nora A.

Results are threefold: the semantic representation of objects increased with better memory, spatial memory was mapped in the lateral occipital cortex, and incongruent objects showed a higher encoding-retrieval similarity compared to congruent objects.</p><p>When recalling what you ate for breakfast last Wednesday, you might not remember the exact meal, but you may confidently select the items you typically eat. Here, semantic knowledge (i.e., what you usually eat) contributes to the reconstructive process of episodic memory retrieval (i.e., what you actually ate). In the current fMRI study, we used a highly realistic virtual environment to test this influence of semantic knowledge on episodic memory retrieval. During the task, 60 participants actively (task-relevant) or passively (task-irrelevant) encountered everyday objects that were either congruent (i.e., rubber duck in the bathroom) or incongruent (i.e., a toaster in the bathroom) with their expected location. Thereby, we created conflicting information between the episodic memory trace (toaster in the bathroom) and semantic information (toaster in the kitchen) during retrieval. Using multivariate analyses, we analyzed the neural basis of this semantic bias. Further, we administered cortisol, typically associated with impaired episodic memory retrieval, to half of the participants prior to retrieval, thereby manipulating the balance between correct episodic and incorrect semantic retrieval. In the lateral occipital cortex (LOC), incongruent task-relevant objects showed greater similarity to their congruent semantic counterparts than did task-irrelevant objects. Notably, spatial memory tended to be reflected in similarity patterns in the LOC. Strikingly, incongruent objects showed a higher pattern reorganization (i.e., pre-/post-encoding similarity) compared to congruent objects, reflecting a difference in neural representation for objects encountered in conflict with prior knowledge. In contrast to our hypotheses, cortisol prior to retrieval had no effect on semantic bias. However, cortisol influenced neural pattern similarity: we found higher pattern reorganization within the posterior hippocampus in the cortisol group. Similarly, we found higher confidence to be linked with similarity patterns in the LOC and lingual gyrus in the placebo, but not in the cortisol group. This indicates an effect of cortisol on memory trace reinstatement during retrieval. Our findings on incongruent object processing contribute to the understanding of how the human brain constructs past episodes from episodic memory traces, suggesting an influence of prior semantic knowledge, reflected in neural similarity patterns.</p>","contentLength":2808,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From Speech Semantics to Brain Activity—Timescales Are Key in Their Information Transfer","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70379?af=R","date":1761395727,"author":"Saket Kumar,  Philipp Klar,  Yasir Çatal,  Han‐Jen Chang,  Friedemann Pulvermüller,  Georg Northoff","guid":686,"unread":true,"content":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d32a6867-6b39-4701-a357-17277472c43f/hbm70379-toc-0001-m.png\" alt=\"From Speech Semantics to Brain Activity—Timescales Are Key in Their Information Transfer\"><p>We analyzed sentence similarity (SBERT) and word depth (WordNet) from the HCP 7 T MOVIE2_HO1.mp4 using dynamic ACW analysis.
