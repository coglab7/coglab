Studies suggest that social interaction facilitates imitative learning, indicating that neural circuits involved in social behaviors can also influence the process of imitation. Vocal imitation in juvenile songbirds serves as a valuable model to investigate this idea. Here, we explore the mechanisms of tutor–pupil social interaction and selective song learning in male zebra finches, with a particular focus on the amygdala, which can regulate social behaviors via its processing of values and emotions in mammals. When sequentially exposed to two tutors, normal pupils selectively learned song from the tutor who sang longer but less frequently. When hearing songs, pupils preferentially approached the selected tutor. Excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala increased pupils’ social motivation toward tutors yet diminished their song-responsive approach, especially to the selected tutor. Whereas the pupils with amygdala lesions retained their ability to imitate song, the tutor selection became more unpredictable with diminished preference for a specific tutor. Neuronal tracing confirmed that the zebra finch amygdala is connected to the circuits involved in social functions but lacks direct connections to those critical for song control and learning. These results suggest that the amygdala regulates social motivation and tutor selection in juvenile zebra finches, highlighting its role in imitative learning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Functional and Regional Specificity of Noradrenergic Signaling for Encoding and Retrieval of Associative Recognition Memory in the Rat</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/24/e2408242025?rss=1</link><author>Tran, S., Barker, G.

Such object-in-place (OiP) memory recruits a neural network including the hippocampus (HPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (NRe); however, the underlying cellular mechanisms are not understood. Locus ceruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons signal novelty; thus here we focused on the contribution of LC–forebrain projections and noradrenaline (NA) receptor subtypes to OiP encoding compared with retrieval, using an arena-based OiP task in male rats. The NRe was found to receive a catecholaminergic input from LC, with the strongest innervation directed to rostral NRe. Interestingly optogenetic inactivation of the LC->NRe pathway impaired OiP retrieval but was without effect on encoding, while inactivation of the LC->HPC selectively impaired encoding. Consistent with this double dissociation, pharmacological blockade of NRe α1-adrenoreceptors selectively impaired memory retrieval, while blockade of HPC β-adrenoreceptors impaired encoding. Finally, pharmacological attenuation of noradrenergic signaling in the NRe and HPC through the infusion of the α2-adrenergic receptor agonist UK 14,304 impaired retrieval and encoding, respectively. Surprisingly, antagonism or agonism of adrenoreceptor subtypes in the mPFC had no effect on memory performance. Together these results reveal the importance of NA within the HPC and NRe for OiP, whereby selectivity of function is achieved via spatially distinct LC output projections and NA receptor subtypes consistent with a modular view of NA function. These results are also important in demonstrating the distinct neuronal mechanisms by which encoding and retrieval are achieved.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zooming In and Out: Selective Attention Modulates Color Signals in Early Visual Cortex for Narrow and Broad Ranges of Task-Relevant Features</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/24/e2097242025?rss=1</link><author>O&amp;#x0308;zkan, M., Chapman, A.

However, many situations require the selection of entire feature ranges instead of just a single feature value, and recent accounts have proposed that broadly tuned attentional templates are often critical for guiding selection in cluttered visual scenes. To assess the neural implementation of such broad tuning of feature-based attention, we here recorded frequency-tagged potentials in human observers (male and female) while participants attended to narrow or broad ranges of colors of spatially intermingled dot fields. Our results show clear increases in the signal strength for the attended colors relative to unattended colors for both narrow and broad color ranges, though this increase was reduced for the broad-range condition, suggesting that limits in the breadth of attentional tuning arise at early processing stages. Overall, the present findings indicate that feature-selective attention can amplify multiple contiguous color values in early visual cortex, shedding light onto the neural mechanisms underlying broad search templates. More generally, they illustrate how feature-based attention can dynamically "zoom in" and "zoom out" in feature space, mirroring models of spatial attention.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Target Selection Signals Causally Influence Human Perceptual Decision-Making</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/24/e2048242025?rss=1</link><author>Pearce, D.

Understanding the neural processes underpinning clinical deficits may provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of decision-making. The N2c has been identified as an EEG signal indexing the efficiency of early target selection, which subsequently influences the timing of perceptual reports through modulating neural evidence accumulation rates. Evidence for the contribution of the N2c to human decision-making however has thus far come from correlational research in neurologically healthy individuals. Here, we capitalized on the superior temporal resolution of EEG to show that unilateral brain lesions in male and female humans were associated with specific deficits in both the timing and strength of the N2c in the damaged hemisphere, with corresponding deficits in the timing of perceptual reports contralaterally. The extent to which the N2c influenced clinical deficits in perceptual reporting speed depended on neural rates of evidence accumulation. This work provides causal evidence that the N2c indexes an early, hemisphere-specific process supporting human decision-making. This noninvasive EEG marker could be used to monitor novel approaches for remediating clinical deficits in perceptual decision-making across a range of brain disorders.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neural Signatures of Flexible Multiple Timing</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/24/e2041242025?rss=1</link><author>Haim, S., Ofir, N., Deouell, L.

Additionally, unexpected events can trigger rapid, on-the-fly adjustments, necessitating quick updating of both timing intervals and action planning. Such events require immediate recalibration of decision variables to allow the system to promptly adapt to new stimuli and update the timing mechanisms accordingly. In this study, we assessed human male and female participants’ ability to track two simultaneous and asynchronous beep trains and determine which one ended first. Due to the stochastic nature of the beeps, participants frequently had to reorient their intended actions in order to identify which train was more likely to have ended. We found that they were able to do this accurately, demonstrating timing performance that was comparable with that of a single train. At the neural level, we recorded slowly evolving EEG potentials that encoded a single interval, the one associated with the currently intended action. Upon an intention switch, when participants had to reorient to a previously unintended action, the EEG response amplitude was reset to reflect the new intended interval. In contrast, when participants were instructed to disregard one of the beep trains, EEG responses solely reflected the intervals of the sequence they attended to. This flexibility in response highlights the brain's ability to dynamically reconfigure cognitive processes in real time, ensuring that actions remain contextually appropriate despite sudden changes in the environment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Continuous Diffusion-Detected Neuroplasticity during Motor Learning</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/24/e1152242025?rss=1</link><author>Friedman, N., Malovani, C., Perets, I., Kenin, E., Bernstein-Eliav, M., Tavor, I.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 16:30:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How does our brain transform when we encounter a new task? To fully answer this question, comparing brain states before and after learning may not be enough, but rather an ongoing, continuous monitoring of brain changes during learning is required. While such continuous examinations of functional learning-induced changes are widely available using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a continuous investigation of diffusion-detected brain modifications during learning is yet to be reported. Here, we continuously acquire diffusion MRI images during task performance. We then compute the mean diffusivity (MD) using a sliding-window approach, resulting in a continuous measure of diffusivity changes throughout learning. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a motor sequence learning (finger tapping) task ( = 58, 30 females). MD decrease was detected in task-related brain regions, including the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), hippocampus, inferior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum. Analysis of the temporal patterns of decrease revealed a rapid MD reduction in the right temporal gyrus after 11 min of training, with additional decrease in the right PHG and left cerebellum after 22 min. We further computed "neuroplasticity networks" of brain areas showing similar change patterns and detected similarities between these networks and canonical functional connectivity networks. Our findings offer novel insights on the spatiotemporal dynamics of diffusion-detected neuroplasticity by demonstrating continuous modifications during the encoding phase of learning itself rather than comparing pre- and postlearning states.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SOAR elucidates biological insights and empowers drug discovery through spatial transcriptomics</title><link>https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.adt7450?af=R</link><author>Yiming Li, Yanyi Ding, Saya Dennis, Meghan R.

Unlike other subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD), PPD is thought to be biologically relatively homogenous, as it is precipitated by a specific biological trigger – the profound hormonal shifts associated with pregnancy and delivery. However, the underlying pathophysiology of PPD is still unclear, with a variety of biological factors likely at play. In this review, we examine recent biological findings related to neuroimaging, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neuroactive steroids (NAS), epigenetics, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) and explore processes that may be unique to PPD versus those shared with MDD, along with avenues of future research aimed at PPD prevention and treatment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Amyloid precursor protein carboxy-terminal fragments as catalyzers of endolysosomal dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00102-X?rss=yes</link><author>Céline Vrancx, Wim Annaert</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><category>review</category><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.cell.com/archive?publicationCode=tins&amp;rss=yes">Trends in Neurosciences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates not only the well-known β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides but also APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). Recent evidence from studies in murine- or human-derived (neuronal) models suggests that APP-CTFs may independently contribute to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology by disrupting cellular homeostasis. This review highlights pathological effects unique to APP-CTFs that are independent of Aβ, shedding light on their distinct role in disease progression. We explore the mechanisms underlying APP-CTF-induced toxicity, with a focus on their contribution to endolysosomal dysfunction. APP-CTFs impair lysosomal function and disrupt calcium signaling between the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, compounding organelle dysfunction. Understanding these mechanisms will aid the design of preventive therapeutic strategies that take into account the impact of APP-CTFs on AD pathology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CD8 T cells as drivers of blood–brain barrier disruption</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(25)00103-1?rss=yes</link><author>Marina Seady, Aaron J.

It is known that proinflammatory cytokines can disrupt tight junctions between endothelial cells of the BBB, allowing larger molecules to penetrate the brain. Along with BBB disruption, these diseases also feature increased numbers of CD8 T cells as components of the immune cell population in the brain. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of CD8 T cell-mediated BBB disruption, including the roles of antigen presentation through MHC class I molecules, which emerge as an important determining feature of BBB disruption and immune cell infiltration into the brain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Computational basis of hierarchical and counterfactual information processing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02232-3</link><author>Mehrdad Jazayeri</author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://feeds.nature.com/nathumbehav/rss/current">Nature Human Behaviour</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ramadan et al. examine how humans deploy hierarchical and counterfactual reasoning strategies given cognitive constraints.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Conversational content is organized across multiple timescales in the brain</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02231-4</link><author>Shinji Nishimoto</author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://feeds.nature.com/nathumbehav/rss/current">Nature Human Behaviour</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Yamashita et al. explore how conversational content is represented in the brain, revealing shared and distinct brain activity patterns for speech production and comprehension, with contrasting timescale properties between the two processes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Online quiz game builds bridges between members of opposite parties</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02226-1</link><author></author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://feeds.nature.com/nathumbehav/rss/current">Nature Human Behaviour</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A cooperative online quiz game called Tango reduced partisan animosity, improved democracy-related attitudes and was rated as highly enjoyable by participants.

However, the intricate task of precisely mapping vasculature across brain regions and cortical layers presents formidable challenges, resulting in a limited understanding of neurometabolic factors influencing the brain’s microvasculature. Addressing this gap, our study investigates whole-brain vascular volume using ferumoxytol-weighted laminar-resolution multi-echo gradient-echo imaging in macaque monkeys. We validate the results with published data for vascular densities and compare them with cytoarchitecture, neuron and synaptic densities. The ferumoxytol-induced change in transverse relaxation rate (ΔR*), an indirect proxy measure of cerebral blood volume (CBV), was mapped onto 12 equivolumetric laminar cortical surfaces. Our findings reveal that CBV varies threefold across the brain, with the highest vascular volume observed in the inferior colliculus and lowest in the corpus callosum. In the cerebral cortex, CBV is notably high in early primary sensory areas and low in association areas responsible for higher cognitive functions. Classification of CBV into distinct groups unveils extensive replication of translaminar vascular network motifs, suggesting distinct computational energy supply requirements in areas with varying cytoarchitecture types. Regionally, baseline R* and CBV exhibit positive correlations with neuron density and negative correlations with receptor densities. Adjusting image resolution based on the critical sampling frequency of penetrating cortical vessels allows us to delineate approximately 30% of the arterial–venous vessels. Collectively, these results mark significant methodological and conceptual advancements, contributing to the refinement of cerebrovascular MRI. Furthermore, our study establishes a linkage between neurometabolic factors and the vascular network architecture in the primate brain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Embedding stochastic dynamics of the environment in spontaneous activity by prediction-based plasticity</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/95243</link><author>Toshitake Asabuki</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The brain learns an internal model of the environment through sensory experiences, which is essential for high-level cognitive processes. Recent studies show that spontaneous activity reflects such a learned internal model. Although computational studies have proposed that Hebbian plasticity can learn the switching dynamics of replayed activities, it is still challenging to learn dynamic spontaneous activity that obeys the statistical properties of sensory experience. Here, we propose a pair of biologically plausible plasticity rules for excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a recurrent spiking neural network model to embed stochastic dynamics in spontaneous activity. The proposed synaptic plasticity rule for excitatory synapses seeks to minimize the discrepancy between stimulus-evoked and internally predicted activity, while inhibitory plasticity maintains the excitatory-inhibitory balance. We show that the spontaneous reactivation of cell assemblies follows the transition statistics of the model’s evoked dynamics. We also demonstrate that simulations of our model can replicate recent experimental results of spontaneous activity in songbirds, suggesting that the proposed plasticity rule might underlie the mechanism by which animals learn internal models of the environment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spectral principal axis system (SPAS) and tuning of tensor-valued encoding for microscopic anisotropy and time-dependent diffusion in the rat brain</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.35/131015/Spectral-principal-axis-system-SPAS-and-tuning-of</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Behavioral and neural evidence for perceptual predictions in social interactions</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.38/131108/Behavioral-and-neural-evidence-for-perceptual</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microstructural Characterization of Short Association Fibers Related to Long‐Range White Matter Tracts in Normative Development</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70255?af=R</link><author>Chloe Cho,  Maxime Chamberland,  Francois Rheault,  Daniel Moyer,  Bennett A.

This paper addresses three key objectives: (1) mapping short association fibers in relation to long-range white matter tracts, (2) characterizing typical neurodevelopmental changes, and (3) investigating the relationship between microstructural changes in SAFs and long-range white matter tracts.Short association fibers (SAFs) in the superficial white matter play a key role in mediating local cortical connections but have not been well-studied as innovations in whole-brain diffusion tractography have only recently been developed to study superficial white matter. Characterizing SAFs and their relationship to long-range white matter tracts is crucial to advance our understanding of neurodevelopment during the period from childhood to young adulthood. This study aims to (1) map SAFs in relation to long-range white matter tracts, (2) characterize typical neurodevelopmental changes across these white matter pathways, and (3) investigate the relationship between microstructural changes in SAFs and long-range white matter tracts. Leveraging a cohort of 616 participants ranging in age from 5.6 to 21.9 years old, we performed quantitative diffusion tractography and advanced diffusion modeling with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). Robust linear regression models were applied to analyze microstructural features, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), and orientation dispersion index (ODI). Our results reveal that both SAFs and long-range tracts exhibit similar overall developmental patterns, characterized by negative associations of MD, AD, and RD with age and positive associations of FA, ICVF, ISOVF, and ODI with age. Notably, FA, AD, and ODI exhibit significant differences between SAFs and long-range tracts, suggesting distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories between superficial and deep white matter. In addition, significant differences were found in MD, RD, and ICVF between males and females, highlighting variations in neurodevelopment. This normative study provides insights into typical microstructural changes of SAFs and long-range white matter tracts during development, laying a foundation for future research to investigate atypical development and dysfunction in disease pathology.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The interoceptive origin of reinforcement learning</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00120-2?rss=yes</link><author>Lilian A.

Traditionally, research on reinforcement learning has centered on how rewards guide learning and decision-making. Here, we examine the origins of rewards themselves. Specifically, we discuss that the critical signal sustaining reinforcement for food is generated internally and subliminally during the process of digestion. As such, a shift in our understanding of primary rewards as an immediate sensory gratification to a state-dependent evaluation of an action’s impact on vital physiological processes is called for. We integrate this perspective into a revised reinforcement learning framework that recognizes the subliminal nature of biological rewards and their dependency on internal states and goals.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using co-sharing to identify use of mainstream news for promoting potentially misleading narratives</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02223-4</link><author>Philip S.

Weak synapses are preferentially removed, but the mechanism linking neuronal activity to synapse removal is unclear. Here, we show that, in the developing mouse visual pathway, inhibiting synaptic transmission induces postsynaptic activation of caspase-3. Caspase-3 deficiency results in defects in synapse elimination driven by both spontaneous and experience-dependent neural activity. Notably, caspase-3 deficiency blocks activity-dependent synapse elimination, as evidenced by reduced engulfment of inactive synapses by microglia. Furthermore, in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, caspase-3 deficiency protects against synapse loss induced by amyloid-β deposition. Our results reveal caspase-3 activation as a key step in activity-dependent synapse elimination during development and synapse loss in neurodegeneration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Human brain ancestral barcodes</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/101163</link><author>Darryl Shibata</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dynamic CpG methylation ‘barcodes’ were read from 15,000–21,000 single cells from three human male brains. To overcome sparse sequencing coverage, the barcode had ~31,000 rapidly fluctuating X-chromosome CpG sites (fCpGs), with at least 500 covered sites per cell and at least 30 common sites between cell pairs (average of ~48). Barcodes appear to start methylated and record mitotic ages because excitatory neurons and glial cells that emerge later in development were less methylated. Barcodes are different between most cells, with average pairwise differences (PWDs) of ~0.5 between cells. About 10 cell pairs per million were more closely related with PWDs <0.05. Barcodes appear to record ancestry and reconstruct trees where more related cells had similar phenotypes, albeit some pairs had phenotypic differences. Inhibitory neurons showed more evidence of tangential migration than excitatory neurons, with related cells in different cortical regions. fCpG barcodes become polymorphic during development and can distinguish between thousands of human cells.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A library of lineage-specific driver lines connects developing neuronal circuits to behavior in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ventral nerve cord</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/106042</link><author>Yu-Chieh David Chen</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Understanding developmental changes in neuronal lineages is crucial to elucidate how they assemble into functional neural networks. Studies investigating nervous system development in model systems have only focused on select regions of the CNS due to the limited availability of genetic drivers that target specific neuronal lineages throughout development and adult life. This has hindered our understanding of how distinct neuronal lineages interconnect to form neuronal circuits during development. Here, we present a split-GAL4 library composed of genetic driver lines, which we generated via editing the genomic locus of lineage-specific transcription factors and demonstrate that we can use this library to specifically target most individual neuronal hemilineages in the  ventral nerve cord (VNC) throughout development and into adulthood. Using these genetic driver lines, we found striking morphological changes in neuronal processes within a lineage during metamorphosis. We also demonstrated how neurochemical features of neuronal classes can be quickly assessed. Lastly, we documented behaviors elicited in response to optogenetic activation of individual neuronal lineages and generated a comprehensive lineage-behavior map of the entire fly VNC. Looking forward, this lineage-specific split-GAL4 driver library will provide the genetic tools needed to address the questions emerging from the analysis of the recent VNC connectome and transcriptome datasets.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intrinsic functional connectivity delineates transmodal language functions</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.25/130902/Intrinsic-functional-connectivity-delineates</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Validating genuine changes in heartbeat-evoked potentials using pseudotrials and surrogate procedures</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.30/130942/Validating-genuine-changes-in-heartbeat-evoked</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Effects of an 18-month meditation training on dynamic functional connectivity states in older adults: Secondary analyses from the Age-Well randomized controlled trial</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.33/131018/Effects-of-an-18-month-meditation-training-on</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Do Transformers and CNNs Learn Different Concepts of Brain Age?</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70243?af=R</link><author>Nys Tjade Siegel,  Dagmar Kainmueller,  Fatma Deniz,  Kerstin Ritter,  Marc‐Andre Schulz</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Mon, 9 Jun 2025 17:23:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(a) Modern shifted window transformer and well-established ResNet50 CNN predicted brain age with on-par accuracy. (b) Effect sizes between prediction errors (brain age gaps, BAGs) of patients and matched controls were similar for CNN and transformers across neurological and psychiatric diseases, yielding no indication that different model architectures base their predictions on different brain aging effects.“Predicted brain age” refers to a biomarker of structural brain health derived from machine learning analysis of T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. A range of machine learning methods have been used to predict brain age, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently yielding state-of-the-art accuracies. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced transformers, which are conceptually distinct from CNNs, and appear to set new benchmarks in various domains of computer vision. Given that transformers are not yet established in brain age prediction, we present three key contributions to this field: First, we examine whether transformers outperform CNNs in predicting brain age. Second, we identify that different deep learning model architectures potentially capture different (sub-)sets of brain aging effects, reflecting divergent “concepts of brain age”. Third, we analyze whether such differences manifest in practice. To investigate these questions, we adapted a Simple Vision Transformer (sViT) and a shifted window transformer (SwinT) to predict brain age, and compared both models with a ResNet50 on 46,381 T1-weighted structural MR images from the UK Biobank. We found that SwinT and ResNet performed on par, though SwinT is likely to surpass ResNet in prediction accuracy with additional training data. Furthermore, to assess whether sViT, SwinT, and ResNet capture different concepts of brain age, we systematically analyzed variations in their predictions and clinical utility for indicating deviations in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Reassuringly, we observed no substantial differences in the structure of brain age predictions across the model architectures. Our findings suggest that the choice of deep learning model architecture does not appear to have a confounding effect on brain age studies.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neurophysiological Basis of Emotional Face Perception and Working Memory Load in a Dual‐Task MEG Study</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70242?af=R</link><author>Katharina Lingelbach,  Jochem W.

Task-relevant negative faces increased evoked magnetic fields in regions associated with emotional face processing and attentional control, while high working memory load decreased alpha and beta power in temporo- and parieto-occipital areas, suggesting greater resource depletion under these conditions. Gaze behavior was affected by an interaction between working memory load and emotional expression.Research on the neurophysiological effects of emotional face processing, working memory (WM) load, and their interaction in dual-tasks remains scarce. Therefore, we conducted a combined magnetoencephalography eye-tracking study with 47 participants. The dual-task temporally interleaved a facial emotion discrimination task with a visuo-spatial n-back task. Source-space cluster analyzes of event-related magnetic fields (ERFs) and oscillations revealed significant main effects of emotional expression and WM load. During emotion discrimination, enhanced ERFs for negative facial expressions located across the insula, ACC, and face-specific occipital regions suggest amplified emotion processing but also the recruitment of attentional control mechanisms. During the n-back phase, emotional faces did not affect evoked responses when they were task-irrelevant. Interaction trends in pupil dilation indicated that emotion-specific processing is diminished under high WM load. During the n-back phase, increased WM load reduced alpha and low beta oscillations in temporo- and parieto-occipital areas. In addition, reduced target fixations in the presence of negative facial distractors indicated a tendency toward emotion-specific interference. Furthermore, sustained increased WM load affected perceived valence, pupil size, and reaction time in both subtasks. A convergence of neurophysiological, physiological, and behavioural findings points to specific processing modes with greater resource depletion for negative expressions and high WM load in the dual-task. In conclusion, the study advanced our understanding of (a) circumstances under which emotional faces modulate ERFs in a dual-task, (b) mechanisms underlying emotion discrimination, (c) interaction effects of emotional expression and WM load in gaze behavior, as well as (d) how WM-related oscillatory alpha and beta power is affected by increasing load.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brain Aging in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease From the UK Biobank</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70252?af=R</link><author>Elizabeth Mcavoy,  Emma A.

This suggests the existence of distinct aging-like patterns within the brain in the precense of cardiovascular conditions. These findings show the complex interaction between cardiovascular health and neurological health.The brain undergoes complex but normal structural changes during the aging process in healthy adults, whereas deviations from the normal aging patterns of the brain can be indicative of various conditions as well as an increased risk for the development of diseases. The brain age gap (BAG), which is defined as the difference between the chronological age and the machine learning-predicted biological age of an individual, is a promising biomarker for determining whether an individual deviates from normal brain aging patterns. While the BAG has shown promise for various neurological diseases and cardiovascular risk factors, its utility to quantify brain changes associated with diagnosed cardiovascular diseases has not been investigated to date, which is the aim of this study. T1-weighted MRI scans from healthy participants in the UK Biobank were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for biological brain age prediction. The trained model was then used to quantify and compare the BAGs for all participants in the UK Biobank with known cardiovascular diseases, as well as healthy controls and patients with known neurological diseases for benchmark comparisons. Saliency maps were computed for each individual to investigate whether brain regions used for biological brain age prediction by the CNN differ between groups. The analyses revealed significant differences in BAG distributions for 10 of the 42 sex-specific cardiovascular disease groups investigated compared to healthy participants, indicating disease-specific variations in brain aging. However, no significant differences were found regarding the brain regions used for brain age prediction as determined by saliency maps, indicating that the model mostly relied on healthy brain aging patterns, even in the presence of cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the findings of this work demonstrate that the BAG is a sensitive imaging biomarker to detect differences in brain aging associated with specific cardiovascular diseases. This further supports the theory of the heart–brain axis by exemplifying that many cardiovascular diseases are associated with atypical brain aging.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Route of fire: Pregame rituals and emotional synchrony among Brazilian football fans</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2422779122?af=R</link><author>Dimitris XygalatasVitor Leandro da Silva ProfetaMohammadamin SaraeiGabriela Baranowski-PintoaDepartment of Anthropology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06111bDepartment of Psychological Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06111cDepartamento de Educação Física, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG 31270-901, BrazildDepartment of Human Movement Sciences, Universidade do Estado de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG 31270-901, Brazil</author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Mon, 9 Jun 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.pnas.org/action/doSearch?af=R">PNAS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 24, June 2025.

TRIO uses its two guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains to activate GTPases (GEF1: Rac1 and RhoG; GEF2: RhoA) that control neuronal development and connectivity. It remains unclear how discrete  variants differentially impact these neurodevelopmental events. Here, we investigate how heterozygosity for NDD-associated  variants –  (ASD),  (SCZ) and  (bipolar disorder, BPD) – impacts mouse behavior, brain development, and synapse structure and function. Heterozygosity for different  variants impacts motor, social, and cognitive behaviors in distinct ways that model clinical phenotypes in humans.  variants differentially impact head and brain size, with corresponding changes in dendritic arbors of motor cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons (M1 L5 PNs). Although neuronal structure was only modestly altered in the  variant heterozygotes, we observe significant changes in synaptic function and plasticity. We also identified distinct changes in glutamate synaptic release in  and  cortico-cortical synapses. The TRIO K1431M GEF1 domain has impaired ability to promote GTP exchange on Rac1, but  mice exhibit increased Rac1 activity, associated with increased levels of the Rac1 GEF Tiam1. Acute Rac1 inhibition with NSC23766 rescued glutamate release deficits in  variant cortex. Our work reveals that discrete NDD-associated  variants yield overlapping but distinct phenotypes in mice, demonstrates an essential role for Trio in presynaptic glutamate release, and underscores the importance of studying the impact of variant heterozygosity in vivo.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unraveling the impact of genetic variants</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/107459</link><author>Bruce Herring</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Mon, 9 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Experiments in mice reveal how three rare mutations in a gene called  can lead to different neurodevelopmental outcomes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Individuals with methamphetamine use disorder show reduced directed exploration and learning rates independent of an aversive interoceptive state induction</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00269-8</link><author>Ryan Smith</author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><pubDate>Sat, 7 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://feeds.nature.com/commspsychol/rss/current">Communications Psychology</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Computational modeling revealed that individuals with methamphetamine use disorder show reduced information-seeking and slower belief-updating when trying to maximize long-term reward.

However, the involvements of DA release, real-time activities, and electrophysiological activities of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in pair bonding remain unclear. This work verified that male mandarin voles after pair bonding released higher levels of DA in the NAc shell and displayed higher levels of D1 MSNs activity and lower levels of D2 MSNs activity upon sniffing their partners compared to upon sniffing an unknown female. Moreover, pair bonding induced differential alterations in both synaptic plasticity and neuronal intrinsic excitability in both D1 MSNs and D2 MSNs. In addition, chemogenetic inhibition of ventral pallidum (VP) -projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell enhanced pair bond formation, while chemogenetic activation of VP-projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell inhibited pair bond formation. These findings suggest that different neuronal activity of NAc shell D1 MSNs / D2 MSNs regulated by increasing DA release after pair bonding may be a neurobiological mechanism underlying pair bond formation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Perception of social experiences and cortical thickness change together throughout early adolescence: Findings from the ABCD cohort</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.27/130905/Perception-of-social-experiences-and-cortical</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Fri, 6 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neural correlates of approach–avoidance tendencies toward physical activity and sedentary stimuli: An MRI study</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.28/130906/Neural-correlates-of-approach-avoidance-tendencies</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Fri, 6 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Functional recruitment and connectivity of the cerebellum is associated with the emergence of Theory of Mind in early childhood</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60523-9</link><author></author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Fri, 6 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.nature.com/subjects/social-neuroscience">Social neuroscience series</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Network Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis Identifies Regional Contributions to Brain Age Prediction</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70239?af=R</link><author>Lingfei He,  Siyu Wang,  Cheng Chen,  Yaping Wang,  Qingcheng Fan,  Congying Chu,  Lingzhong Fan,  Junhai Xu</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 11:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A low-bias, lightweight deep learning model for brain age prediction reveals the human brain's aging process through network occlusion sensitivity analysis, identifying the thalamus's dominant role across the lifespan. The frontoparietal and default mode networks show a peak-shaped contribution pattern from development to aging.Deep learning frameworks utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have frequently been used for brain age prediction and have achieved outstanding performance. Nevertheless, deep learning remains a black box as it is hard to interpret which brain parts contribute significantly to the predictions. To tackle this challenge, we first trained a lightweight, fully CNN model for brain age estimation on a large sample data set ( = 3054, age range = [8,80 years]) and tested it on an independent data set ( = 555, age range = [8,80 years]). We then developed an interpretable scheme combining network occlusion sensitivity analysis (NOSA) with a fine-grained human brain atlas to uncover the learned invariance of the model. Our findings show that the dorsolateral, dorsomedial frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus had the highest contributions to age prediction across the lifespan. More interestingly, we observed that different regions showed divergent patterns in their predictions for specific age groups and that the bilateral hemispheres contributed differently to the predictions. Regions in the frontal lobe were essential predictors in both the developmental and aging stages, with the thalamus remaining relatively stable and saliently correlated with other regional changes throughout the lifespan. The lateral and medial temporal brain regions gradually became involved during the aging phase. At the network level, the frontoparietal and the default mode networks show an inverted U-shape contribution from the developmental to the aging stages. The framework could identify regional contributions to the brain age prediction model, which could help increase the model interpretability when serving as an aging biomarker.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neuroanatomical Changes in the Stopping Network Across the Adult Lifespan Assessed With Quantitative and Diffusion MRI</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70240?af=R</link><author>Sarah A.

We examined age-related anatomical changes to the response inhibition network using diffusion and quantitative MRI, and found that white matter degradation and iron accumulation may drive these observed behavioural changes.Response inhibition, the cancellation of planned movement, is essential for everyday motor control. Extensive fMRI and brain stimulation research provides evidence for the crucial role of a number of cortical and subcortical regions in response inhibition, including the subthalamic nucleus (STN), presupplementary motor area (preSMA) and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Current models assume that these regions operate as a network, with action cancellation originating in the cortical areas and then executed rapidly via the subcortex. Response inhibition slows in older age, a change that has been attributed to deterioration or changes in the connectivity and integrity of this network. However, previous research has mainly used whole-brain approaches when investigating changes in structural connectivity across the lifespan or has used simpler measures to investigate structural ageing. Here, we used high-resolution quantitative and diffusion MRI to extensively examine the anatomical changes that occur in this network across the lifespan. We found age-related changes in iron concentration in these tracts, increases in the apparent diffusion coefficient and some evidence for a decrease in myelin content. Conversely, we found very little evidence for age-related anatomical changes in the regions themselves. We propose that some of the functional changes observed in these regions in older adult populations (e.g., increased BOLD recruitment) are a reflection of alterations to the connectivity between the regions rather than localised regional change.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>On the Robustness and Provenance of the Gambler’s Fallacy</title><link>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976251344570?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R</link><author>Yang Xiang, Kevin Dorst, Samuel J.

The brain must hence take uncertainty into account when updating its internal model of the world. The basis for updating the model are prediction errors that arise from a difference between the current model and new sensory experiences. Although prediction error neurons have been identified in layer 2/3 of diverse brain areas, how uncertainty modulates these errors and hence learning is, however, unclear. Here, we use a normative approach to derive how uncertainty should modulate prediction errors and postulate that layer 2/3 neurons represent uncertainty-modulated prediction errors (UPE). We further hypothesise that the layer 2/3 circuit calculates the UPE through the subtractive and divisive inhibition by different inhibitory cell types. By implementing the calculation of UPEs in a microcircuit model, we show that different cell types can compute the means and variances of the stimulus distribution. With local activity-dependent plasticity rules, these computations can be learned context-dependently, and allow the prediction of upcoming stimuli and their distribution. Finally, the mechanism enables an organism to optimise its learning strategy via adaptive learning rates.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Context-dependent modulations of subthalamo-cortical synchronization during rapid reversals of movement direction in Parkinson’s disease</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/101769</link><author>Petra Fischer</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The role of beta band activity in cortico-basal ganglia interactions during motor control has been studied extensively in resting-state and for simple movements, such as button pressing. However, little is known about how beta oscillations change and interact in more complex situations involving rapid changes of movement in various contexts. To close this knowledge gap, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potential recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson’s disease patients to study beta dynamics during initiation, stopping, and rapid reversal of rotational movements. The action prompts were manipulated to be predictable vs. unpredictable. We observed movement-related beta suppression at motor sequence start, and a beta rebound after motor sequence stop in STN power, motor cortical power, and STN-cortex coherence. Despite involving a brief stop of movement, no clear rebound was observed during reversals of turning direction. At the cortical level, beta power decreased bilaterally following reversals, but more so in the hemisphere ipsilateral to movement, due to a floor effect on the contralateral side. In the STN, power modulations varied across patients, with patients displaying brief increases or decreases of high-beta power. Importantly, cue predictability affected these modulations. Event-related increases of STN-cortex beta coherence were generally stronger in the unpredictable than in the predictable condition. In summary, this study reveals the influence of movement context on beta oscillations in basal ganglia-cortex loops when humans change ongoing movements according to external cues. We find that movement scenarios requiring higher levels of caution involve enhanced modulations of subthalamo-cortical beta synchronization. Furthermore, our results confirm that beta oscillations reflect the start and end of motor sequences better than movement changes within a sequence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Imaging of brain electric field networks with spatially resolved EEG</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/100123</link><author>Vitaly L Galinsky</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We present a method for spatially resolving the electric field potential throughout the entire volume of the human brain from electroencephalography (EEG) data. The method is  a variation of the well-known ‘source reconstruction’ methods, but rather a direct solution to the EEG inverse problem based on our recently developed model for brain waves that demonstrates the inadequacy of the standard ‘quasi-static approximation’ that has fostered the belief that such a reconstruction is not physically possible. The method retains the high temporal/frequency resolution of EEG, yet has spatial resolution comparable to (or better than) functional MRI (fMRI), without its significant inherent limitations. The method is validated using simultaneous EEG/fMRI data in healthy subjects, intracranial EEG data in epilepsy patients, comparison with numerical simulations, and a direct comparison with standard state-of-the-art EEG analysis in a well-established attention paradigm. The method is then demonstrated on a very large cohort of subjects performing a standard gambling task designed to activate the brain’s ‘reward circuit’. The technique uses the output from standard extant EEG systems and thus has potential for immediate benefit to a broad range of important basic scientific and clinical questions concerning brain electrical activity. By offering an inexpensive and portable alternative to fMRI, it provides a realistic methodology to efficiently promote the democratization of medicine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Location- and feature-based selection histories make independent, qualitatively distinct contributions to urgent visuomotor performance</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/100280</link><author>Terrence R Stanford</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Attention mechanisms guide visuomotor behavior by weighing physical salience and internal goals to prioritize stimuli as choices for action. Although less well studied, selection history, which reflects multiple facets of experience with recent events, is increasingly recognized as a distinct source of attentional bias. To examine how selection history impacts saccadic choices, we trained two macaque monkeys to perform an urgent version of an oddball search task in which a red target appeared among three green distracters or vice versa. By imposing urgency, performance could be tracked continuously as it transitioned from uninformed guesses to informed choices as a function of processing time. This, in turn, permitted assessment of attentional control as manifest in motor biases, processing speed, and asymptotic accuracy. Here, we found that the probability of making a correct choice was strongly modulated by the histories of preceding target locations and target colors. Crucially, although both effects were gated by success (or reward), their dynamics were clearly distinct: whereas location history promoted a motor bias, color history modulated perceptual sensitivity, and these influences acted independently. Thus, combined selection histories can give rise to enormous swings in visuomotor performance even in simple tasks with highly discriminable stimuli.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Electrophysiological signatures of ongoing thoughts during naturalistic behavior</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.20/130859/Electrophysiological-signatures-of-ongoing</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Visual body part representation of the lateral occipitotemporal cortex in individuals with autism spectrum disorder: A univariate and multivariate fMRI study</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.24/130904/Visual-body-part-representation-of-the-lateral</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 5 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elucidating Development Trajectories of Brain Functional Abnormalities in Major Depressive Disorder Utilizing a Data‐Driven Disease Progression Model</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70249?af=R</link><author>Yuhong Zheng,  Peng Wang,  Chi Yao,  Jinghua Wang,  Jinhui Wang,  Shao‐Wei Xue</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 4 Jun 2025 23:50:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Major depressive disorder exhibits profound phenotypic and temporal heterogeneity. This study aims to identify distinct brain change trajectories in MDD using the subtype and stage inference model to deepen our understanding of heterogeneity, as well as to compare the cognitive function change patterns among subtypes with different trajectories.Concerns have arisen regarding the heterogeneity of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), particularly when the varying disease progression trajectories among individuals are overlooked. Recognizing these distinct trajectories is crucial for personalized assessments and accurate disease progression predictions in MDD, posing a significant challenge in clinical practice. We utilized a data-driven subtype and stage inference (SuStaIn) model to infer trajectories based on cross-sectional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 833 patients with MDD and 834 healthy controls. Based on distinct trajectories, two subtypes of MDD were identified: Subtype 1 showed declining ALFF from paracentral lobule (PCL) to thalamus to medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFCmed), with higher core depression scores and gray matter atrophy, whereas Subtype 2 had an opposing trajectory, with initial OFCmed ALFF decrease gradually extending to PCL. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of MDD heterogeneity and facilitate precise disease progression predictions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Anterior Insula Processes a Time-Resolved Subjective Risk Prediction Error</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/23/e2302242025?rss=1</link><author>Kim, J.-C., Hellrung, L., Nebe, S., Tobler, P.

However, the nature of the encoded risk prediction error signals remained unclear. Moreover, the insula was proposed to preferentially process events and stimuli in the aversive domain, rather than in a domain-general fashion. Here, we aimed to illuminate these issues. In a Pavlovian task, participants ( = 41; 19 women) rated both cues and outcomes, allowing us to quantify not only objective but also trial-specific subjective risk prediction errors. We found preferential coding of subjective risk prediction errors in the anterior insula and adjacent frontal cortex. This contrasted with preferential coding of objective risk prediction errors in the mid-insula. The anterior insula encoded the subjective risk prediction errors not only at the time of outcomes but also at the time of cues, in line with a temporally fine-grained computation of these prediction errors. Cue-induced subjective risk prediction error signals occurred predominantly in the aversive domain, while outcome-induced subjective risk prediction error signals occurred also in the appetitive domain. Domain-specific analyses of risk prediction errors elicited by the preceding outcome at the time of the next cue indicated that the anterior insula updates risk predictions more strongly in the aversive than the appetitive domain.

Previous work in humans showed a relationship between initial cortical excitation, as indicated by the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), prestimulus alpha oscillations, and the perceived intensity in a somatosensory discrimination paradigm. Here we address the follow-up question whether these excitability dynamics reflect changes in feedforward or feedback signals. To distinguish feedforward neural signals from feedback signals, we leveraged high-frequency oscillations (HFO) which have previously been shown to correspond to neuronal population spiking activity of the first excitatory feedforward volley in the somatosensory cortex. We examined these HFO in electroencephalography (EEG) data of 32 male human participants, performing a somatosensory intensity discrimination task. Spatial filtering and time–frequency analyses allowed to clearly distinguish HFO from the lower-frequency, conventional SEP. Using Bayesian statistics, we found evidence against the involvement of HFO in moment-to-moment variability of perceived stimulus intensity, in contrast to previously observed prestimulus alpha and N20 effects of the conventional SEP. Given that the N20 component presumably reflects backpropagating membrane potentials toward the apical dendrites (distal dendritic sites), we argue that top-down feedback processes (e.g., related to alpha oscillations) may thus rely on activity modulations at those distal dendrites of involved pyramidal cells rather than on synchronous output firing changes at their basal compartments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Uncertainty, Not Mental Content, Drives Dorsomedial Prefrontal Engagement during Inferences about Others</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/23/e1920232025?rss=1</link><author>Berkay, D., Jenkins, A.

A network of brain regions consistently engages more during mentalizing than during carefully controlled comparison tasks, sometimes cited as evidence of domain-specific mentalizing processes. Here we investigated the possibility that engagement of these regions during mentalizing may be due to uncertainty. We scanned 46 participants (33 female, 13 male) using fMRI as they made mental and non-mental inferences (about human minds, human bodies, and physical objects) under varying levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty explained activation in a key region of the mentalizing network: the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). Higher uncertainty was associated with greater DMPFC engagement across conditions, and, when controlling for uncertainty, DMPFC engagement did not differentiate mental from non-mental inferences. Results suggest that the apparently selective DMPFC engagement during social inference may be better understood as a response to uncertainty, which is often elevated in social contexts, with implications for the cognitive architecture of the social brain and disorders of social function.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stimulus Repetition Induces a Two-Stage Learning Process in the Primary Visual Cortex</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/23/e1788242025?rss=1</link><author>Cui, L., Bo, K., Xiong, C., Chen, Y., Keil, A., Ding, M.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 4 Jun 2025 16:30:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Repeated stimulus exposure alters the brain's response to the stimulus. Recording fMRI data from both men and women viewing 120 presentations of two Gabor patches (each Gabor repeating 60 times), we evaluated support for two prominent models of stimulus repetition, the fatigue model and the sharpening model. Our results uncovered a two-stage learning process in the primary visual cortex. In Stage 1, univariate BOLD activation in V1 decreased over the first 14 repetitions of the stimuli, replicating the well known effect of repetition suppression. Applying moving-window multivoxel pattern analysis decoding, we found that (1) the decoding accuracy between the two Gabors decreased from the above-chance level (~60 to ~70%) at the beginning of the stage to the chance level at the end of the stage (~50%). This result, together with the accompanying weight map analysis, suggested that the learning dynamics in Stage 1 were consistent with the predictions of the fatigue model. In Stage 2, univariate BOLD activation for the remaining 46 repetitions of the two stimuli exhibited significant fluctuations but no systematic trend. The moving-window decoding accuracy between the two Gabor patches was at the chance level initially and became progressively higher as stimulus repetition continued, rising above and staying above the chance level starting at the ~36th repetition. Thus, results from the second stage supported the notion that sustained and prolonged stimulus repetition prompts sharpened representations. Additional analyses addressed (1) whether the neural patterns within each learning stage remained stable and (2) whether new neural patterns were evoked in Stage 2 relative to Stage 1.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neural Processes Linking Interoception to Moral Preferences Aligned with Group Consensus</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/23/e1114242025?rss=1</link><author>Kim, J., Kim, H.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 4 Jun 2025 16:30:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Aligning one's decisions with the prevailing social norms and expectations of those around us constitutes a fundamental facet of moral decision-making. When faced with conflicting moral values, one adaptive approach is to rely on intuitive moral preference. Although theoretical accounts have proposed a link between moral preferences and interoceptive awareness—the capacity to sense internal bodily signals, this connection has not been empirically examined. This study examines the relationship between moral preferences and interoception, measured with self-report, heartbeat counting task, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Two independent experiments demonstrate that both male and female participants’ interoceptive awareness and accuracy are associated with their moral preferences aligned with group consensus. In addition, the fractional occupancies of resting-state brain states involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus mediated this relationship. These findings provide empirical evidence of the neural mechanism linking interoception to moral preferences aligned with group consensus.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cerebellar Activity Affects Distal Cortical Physiology and Synaptic Plasticity in a Human Parietal-Motor Pathway Associated with Motor Actions</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/23/e0404252025?rss=1</link><author>Goldenkoff, E.

It is thought that one role of the CB is to regulate communication between PPC and M1, but causal evidence for this regulatory role in humans remains lacking. Here, we evaluated how transiently altering activity in CB via intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) affects PPC–M1 connectivity and plasticity by assessing the effectiveness of subsequent Hebbian-like cortical paired associative stimulation (cPAS) to PPC and M1. Using a within-subject design, we administered four different single-session stimulation conditions to the CB and parietal–motor pathway of the motor network and measured the aftereffects on plasticity (both sexes). We administered iTBS to the right CB or right visual cortex, followed by cPAS of a parietal–motor circuit in the left hemisphere. In a subset of participants, we performed two additional control conditions to assess the effect of CB iTBS alone and Hebbian-like cPAS of the PPC–M1 circuit alone. We evaluated motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation as a measure of motor cortical excitability before and after each plasticity induction protocol. Cerebellar iTBS reduced cPAS-induced plasticity in the parietal–motor circuit, as evidenced by a decrease in MEPs. These responses were selective, as no decreases in excitability were observed during the control experiments. These findings suggest that CB activity can modify distal neural activity in a network-connected parietal–motor circuit through heterosynaptic metaplasticity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Relating Scene Memory and Perception Activity to Functional Properties, Networks, and Landmarks of Posterior Cerebral Cortex--A Probabilistic Atlas</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/23/e0028252025?rss=1</link><author>Steel, A., Prasad, D., Garcia, B.

Recent work has implicated three brain areas in posterior cerebral cortex—the place memory areas (PMAs) that are anterior to the three visual scene perception areas (SPAs)–in this function. However, PMAs' relationship to the broader cortical hierarchy remains unclear due to limited group-level characterization. Here, we examined the PMA and SPA locations across three fMRI datasets (44 participants, 29 female). SPAs were identified using a standard visual localizer where participants viewed scenes versus faces. PMAs were identified by contrasting activity when participants recalled personally familiar places versus familiar faces (Datasets 1–2) or places versus multiple categories (familiar faces, bodies, and objects, and famous faces; Dataset 3). Across datasets, the PMAs were located anterior to the SPAs on the ventral and lateral cortical surfaces. The anterior displacement between PMAs and SPAs was highly reproducible. Compared with public atlases, the PMAs fell at the boundary between externally oriented networks (dorsal attention) and internally oriented networks (default mode). Additionally, while SPAs overlapped with retinotopic maps, the PMAs were consistently located anterior to mapped visual cortex. These results establish the anatomical position of the PMAs at inflection points along the cortical hierarchy between unimodal sensory and transmodal, apical regions, which informs broader theories of how the brain integrates perception and memory for scenes. We have released probabilistic parcels of these regions to facilitate future research into their roles in spatial cognition.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Aphantasia as a functional disconnection</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00124-X?rss=yes</link><author>Jianghao Liu, Paolo Bartolomeo</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><category>review</category><pubDate>Wed, 4 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.cell.com/archive?publicationCode=tics&amp;rss=yes">Trends in Cognitive Sciences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adam Zeman's recent review of mental imagery extremes [1] offers a thorough and balanced synthesis of current perspectives on aphantasia.

Despite their functional distinctions, the neural substrates of recognition and navigation share some commonalities, but many aspects of their relationship remain debated, particularly concerning the role of the hippocampus. We synthesize recent primate studies to examine how the hippocampus and related regions contribute to recognition memory and spatial navigation. We highlight that scene recognition, an ethologically relevant process for primates, is closely linked to spatial navigation. Emerging behavioral and physiological evidence suggests that while recognition and navigation share overlapping circuitry, they engage partially dissociable neural mechanisms. We argue that their interplay can be better understood through the framework of reference frame transformation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Not just neurons: The diverse cellular landscape of learning and memory</title><link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00352-6?rss=yes</link><author>Cristina M.

In humans, an inability to recognize kin and familiar individuals and engage in appropriate behaviors is associated with several types of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. Mice preferentially spend more time investigating a novel individual relative to a familiar individual. Yet, how social novelty-related information drives increased investigation of the novel animal remains poorly understood. Recent evidence has implicated the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) as a key node in encoding information about conspecific identity. Of particular interest are vHPC projections to the lateral septum (LS), a region that has been implicated in driving a wide range of motivated social behaviors. In this study using chemogenetics, optogenetics, and monosynaptic rabies tracing, we identified a novel vHPC-LS-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathway that is necessary for mice to preferentially investigate novel conspecifics. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we established that LS neurons make direct monosynaptic connections onto dopaminergic neurons in the VTA. Thus, we have identified a potential pathway via which conspecific identity could be transformed to drive motivated social behaviors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Functional interaction between posterior cerebellar lobes and secondary somatosensory cortex during somatosensory mismatch detection</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00572/128909/Functional-interaction-between-posterior</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 4 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brain wiring economics, network organisation and population-level genomics</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.31/130943/Brain-wiring-economics-network-organisation-and</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 4 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spatio‐Temporal Signatures of Cognitive Function After Pediatric Arterial Ischemic Stroke—A Pilot Study</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70248?af=R</link><author>Karl‐Heinz Nenning,  Florian Ph.

We found that in particular increased dynamics of a frontoparietal state were associated with lower cognitive performance, and that the location of a focal lesion was more informative than lesion size alone.Childhood arterial ischemic stroke is a severe disorder that can cause lasting cognitive impairments, particularly in executive functions. Although early research assumed an improved outcome in childhood stroke patients compared to adults, more recent studies indicate similar rates of disabilities and cognitive impairment, with widespread brain network disruptions underlying these deficits. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to study alterations in functional brain dynamics and their association with cognitive outcome in children and adolescents after childhood stroke. We used co-activation pattern analysis to characterize five recurring brain states and their temporal properties in a cohort of 16 patients and 17 age-matched controls. We found that in pediatric stroke patients, a specific brain state characterizing the frontoparietal network was more prevalent and more frequently involved in state transitions. This was paralleled by lower occurrence rates of a brain state related to default mode network deactivation. Moreover, our analysis showed that these dynamics relate more to the extent to which the lesion impacts functional networks than to lesion size alone. Taken together, our findings suggest that disrupted brain dynamics following childhood stroke relate to cognitive performance and that the location of a focal lesion can have wide-ranging implications on brain state dynamics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mapping Caudolenticular Gray Matter Bridges in the Human Brain Striatum Through Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Tractography</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70245?af=R</link><author>Graham Little,  Charles Poirier,  Arnaud Bore,  Martin Parent,  Laurent Petit,  Maxime Descoteaux</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 3 Jun 2025 14:21:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This work demonstrates that diffusion MRI is sensitive to an anisotropic signal oriented along the caudolenticular gray matter bridges (CLGBs) of the striatum. A tractography approach was developed to track this signal, reconstructing the CLGBs and demonstrating that the signal is present across the entirety of these gray matter structures.In primates, the putamen and the caudate nucleus are connected by ~1 mm-thick caudolenticular gray matter bridges (CLGBs) interspersed between the white matter bundles of the internal capsule. Little is understood about the functional or microstructural properties of the CLGBs. In studies proposing high resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) techniques, CLGBs have been qualitatively identified as an example of superior imaging quality; however, the microstructural properties of these structures have yet to be examined. In this study, it is demonstrated for the first time that dMRI is sensitive to an organized anisotropic signal oriented in the direction parallel to the CLGBs, suggesting that dMRI could be a useful imaging method for probing the microstructure of the CLGBs. To demonstrate the anisotropic diffusion signal is coherently organized along the extent of the CLGBs and to enable a subsequent CLGB microstructural measurement, a customized tractography seeding and filtering method is proposed that utilizes the shape of the human striatum (putamen + caudate nucleus) to reconstruct the CLGBs in 3D. The proposed seeding strategy seeds tractography streamlines outward and normal to the surface of a 3D model of the striatum such that reconstructed streamlines are more likely to follow the diffusion signal peaks aligned parallel to the CLGBs. The method is applied to three different diffusion datasets, namely a high resolution 760 μm isotropic diffusion dataset acquired on a single subject, the test–retest cohort included as part of the human connectome project ( = 44) with diffusion data acquired at 1.25 mm isotropic, and a locally acquired “clinical” test–retest dataset acquired at 2.0 mm isotropic ( = 24). Reconstructed CLGBs directly overlap expected gray matter regions in the human brain for all three datasets. In addition, the method is shown to accurately reconstruct CLGBs repeatedly across multiple test–retest cohorts. The tractography CLGB reconstructions are then used to extract a quantitative measurement of microstructure from a local model of the diffusion signal along the CLGBs themselves. This is the first work to comprehensively study the CLGBs in vivo using dMRI and presents techniques suitable for future human neuroscience studies targeting these structures.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stereotyped beliefs about the self are acquired early</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-025-00461-x</link><author>Brandon A.

The anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is a hub for semantic memory, which generates coherent conceptual representations. GABAergic inhibition plays a crucial role in shaping human cognition and plasticity, but it is unclear how this inhibition relates to human semantic memory and its plasticity. Here, we employed a combination of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), MR spectroscopy and fMRI to investigate the role of GABA in semantic memory and its neuroplasticity. We found that inhibitory cTBS increased GABA concentrations in the ATL and reduced blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation during semantic tasks. Crucially, changes in GABA were tightly linked to changes in regional activity, suggesting that GABA mediates cTBS-induced plasticity. Individuals with better semantic performance exhibited selective activity in the ATL, attributable to higher GABA levels, which can sharpen distributed semantic representations. Our results revealed a non-linear, inverted-U-shape relationship between GABA levels in the ATL and semantic performance, thus offering an explanation for the individual differences in semantic memory function and neuromodulation outcomes. These findings offer a neurochemical explanation for individual variability in neuromodulation and provide insights for developing targeted interventions for semantic impairments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Comparing methods for deriving the auditory brainstem response to continuous speech in human listeners</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.19/130858/Comparing-methods-for-deriving-the-auditory</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 3 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Arousal and sustained attention fluctuate differently with respiration in younger and older adults</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.26/130903/Arousal-and-sustained-attention-fluctuate</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 3 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Structure–function coupling in the first month of life: Associations with age and attention</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2412729122?af=R</link><author>Ursula A.

Stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) are a potentially powerful alternative to traditional behavioral experiments for estimating cochlear tuning without invasive testing, as is necessary in humans. Which methods accurately predict cochlear tuning remains controversial due to only a single animal study comparing SFOAE-based, behavioral, and cochlear frequency tuning in the same species. The budgerigar () is a parakeet species with human-like behavioral sensitivity to many sounds and the capacity to mimic speech. Intriguingly, previous studies of critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios in budgerigars show that behavioral tuning sharpness increases dramatically with increasing frequency from 1 to 3.5 kHz, doubling once per octave with peak tuning sharpness from 3.5 to 4 kHz. The pattern contrasts with slower monotonic growth of behavioral tuning sharpness with increasing frequency in other animals, including most avian species, suggesting a possible auditory specialization in budgerigars. We measured SFOAE-based and cochlear-afferent tuning in budgerigars, for comparison to previously reported behavioral results. SFOAE-based and cochlear-afferent tuning sharpness both increased monotonically and relatively slowly for higher frequencies, in contrast to the behavioral pattern. SFOAE-based tuning in budgerigars accurately predicted cochlear frequency tuning, and both measures aligned with typical patterns of cochlear tuning in other species. Divergent behavioral tuning in budgerigars is unlikely attributable to the periphery and could reflect specializations for central processing of masked signals. Our findings highlight the value of SFOAEs for estimating cochlear tuning and caution against direct inference of peripheral tuning from behavioral critical bands, psychophysical tuning curves, and critical ratios.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chemogenetic stimulation of phrenic motor output and diaphragm activity</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/97846</link><author>Victoria N Jensen</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Mon, 2 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Impaired respiratory motor output contributes to morbidity and mortality in many neurodegenerative diseases and neurologic injuries. We investigated if expressing designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the mid-cervical spinal cord could effectively stimulate phrenic motor output to increase diaphragm activation. Two primary questions were addressed: (1) does effective DREADD-mediated diaphragm activation require focal expression in phrenic motoneurons (vs. non-specific mid-cervical expression), and (2) can this method produce a sustained increase in inspiratory tidal volume? Wild-type (C57Bl/6) and ChAT-Cre mice received bilateral intraspinal (C4) injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the hM3D(Gq) excitatory DREADD. In wild-type mice, this produced non-specific DREADD expression throughout the mid-cervical ventral horn. In ChAT-Cre mice, a Cre-dependent viral construct was used to drive neuronal DREADD expression in the C4 ventral horns, targeting phrenic motoneurons. Diaphragm electromyograms (EMG) were recorded in isoflurane-anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice at 4–9 weeks post-AAV delivery. The DREADD ligand JHU37160 (J60) caused a bilateral, sustained (>1 hr) increase in inspiratory EMG bursting in both groups; the relative increase was greater in ChAT-Cre mice. Additional experiments in ChAT-Cre rats were conducted to determine if spinal DREADD activation could increase inspiratory tidal volume during spontaneous breathing, assessed using whole-body plethysmography without anesthesia. Three to four months after intraspinal (C4) injection of AAV driving Cre-dependent hM3D(Gq) expression, intravenous J60 resulted in a sustained (>30 min) increase in tidal volume. Subsequently, phrenic nerve recordings performed under urethane anesthesia confirmed that J60 evoked a >200% increase in inspiratory output. We conclude that targeting mid-cervical spinal DREADD expression to the phrenic motoneuron pool enables ligand-induced, sustained increases in phrenic motor output and tidal volume. Further development of this technology may enable application to clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation and hypoventilation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Physics versus graphics as an organizing dichotomy in cognition</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00116-0?rss=yes</link><author>Halely Balaban, Tomer D.

EWC captures inter-regional communication by first identifying spontaneous, endogenous perturbations, or “events”, from neural recordings, and then tracking their propagation by gauging post-perturbation statistical effects on downstream regions, using Functional Connectivity.Tracking how activity or signal perturbations propagate in nervous systems is crucial to understanding interareal communication in the brain. Current analytical methodologies are not well suited to systematically infer interareal activity propagation from neural time series recordings. Here, we propose Event-marked Windowed Communication (EWC), a framework to infer activity propagation between neural elements by tracking the statistical consequence of spontaneous, endogenous regional perturbations. EWC tracks the downstream effect of these perturbations by subsampling the neural time series and quantifying statistical dependences using established functional connectivity measures. We test EWC on simulations of neural dynamics and demonstrate the retrieval of ground truth motifs of directional signaling, over a range of model configurations. We also show that EWC can capture activity propagation in a computationally efficient manner by benchmarking it against more advanced FC estimation methods such as transfer entropy. Lastly, we showcase the utility of EWC to infer whole-brain activity propagation maps from magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Networks computed using EWC were compared to those inferred using transfer entropy and were found to be highly correlated (median  = 0.81 across subjects). Importantly, our framework is flexible and can be applied to activity time series captured by diverse functional neuroimaging modalities, opening new avenues for the study of neural communication.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Perceived Social Norms and Vaccine Hesitancy</title><link>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09637214251340023?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R</link><author>Robert C.

Two hundred and four individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) were enrolled in this study. All subjects completed neuropsychological assessments and underwent 18F-florbetapir PET, structural MRI, and functional MRI. A total of 315 features were extracted from the MRI, demographics, and neuropsychological scales and selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The logistic regression (LR) model, based on machine learning, was trained to classify SCD as either β-amyloid (Aβ) positive or negative. A nomogram was established using a multivariate LR model to predict the risk of Aβ+. The performance of the prediction model and nomogram was assessed with area under the curve (AUC) and calibration. The final model was based on the right rostral anterior cingulate thickness, the grey matter volume of the right inferior temporal, the ReHo of the left posterior cingulate gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus, as well as MoCA-B and AVLT-R. In the training set, the model achieved a good AUC of 0.78 for predicting Aβ+, with an accuracy of 0.72. The validation of the model also yielded a favorable discriminatory ability with an AUC of 0.88 and an accuracy of 0.83. We have established and validated a model based on cognitive, sMRI, and fMRI data that exhibits adequate discrimination. This model has the potential to predict amyloid status in the SCD group and provide a noninvasive, cost-effective way that might facilitate early screening, clinical diagnosis, and drug clinical trials.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using the Nested Structure of Knowledge to Infer What Others Know</title><link>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976251339633?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R</link><author>Edgar Dubourg, Thomas Dheilly, Hugo Mercier, Olivier MorinInstitut Jean Nicod, Département d’Études Cognitives, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Ecole des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Université PSL, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)</author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 06:47:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/pssa?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R">Psychological Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Psychological Science, Ahead of Print.

This distinction has inspired efforts to define separable brain bases of each, with emotion generation thought to involve mainly subcortical structures such as the amygdala, and emotion regulation thought to involve mainly cortical regions such as fronto-parietal cortices. However, emerging findings challenge strong neural separability accounts, revealing substantial overlap between brain systems underlying emotion generation and emotion regulation. In this opinion article we review evidence that supports and challenges neural separability. Based on this evidence, we propose an updated neural account using a valuation-systems perspective that incorporates both common and distinct brain bases of emotion generation and emotion regulation. Finally, we discuss implications for next-generation study designs, methods, and clinical interventions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inflammation alters cognition after cancer immunotherapy</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00935-0</link><author>Katherine Whalley</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><category>review</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://feeds.nature.com/nrn/rss/current">Nature Reviews Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Neuroinflammatory mechanisms drive cognitive impairments in mice treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AgRP1 modulates breeding season-dependent feeding behavior in female medaka</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/100996</link><author>Yurika Tagui</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Feeding and reproduction are known to be closely correlated with each other, and the seasonal breeders show breeding season-dependent feeding behavior.

CIT is associated with impaired metacognition, which in turn has been associated with cognitive offloading behaviours such as external reminder setting that play a key role in fulfilling cognitive goals. In an online study (=600), we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support. Along with transdiagnostic variation in the general population, this finding could also have implications for clinical conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Modeling dynamic inflow effects in fMRI to quantify cerebrospinal fluid flow</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.9/130662/Modeling-dynamic-inflow-effects-in-fMRI-to</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Interhemispheric integration in the neural face perception network: Does stimulus location matter?</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.17/130767/Interhemispheric-integration-in-the-neural-face</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Decomposing Cognitive Processes in the mPFC during Self-Thinking</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e2378242025?rss=1</link><author>Levorsen, M., Aoki, R., Sedikides, C., Izuma, K.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 16:30:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Past cognitive neuroscience research has demonstrated that thinking about both the self and other activates the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a central hub of the default mode network. The mPFC is also implicated in other cognitive processes, such as introspection and autobiographical memory, rendering elusive its exact role during thinking about the self. Specifically, it is unclear whether the same cognitive process explains the common mPFC involvement or distinct processes are responsible for the mPFC activation overlap. In this preregistered functional magnetic resonance imaging study with 35 male and female human participants, we investigated whether and to what extent mPFC activation patterns during self-reference judgment could be explained by activation patterns during the tasks of other-reference judgment, introspection, and autobiographical memory. Multivoxel pattern analysis showed that only in the mPFC were neural responses both concurrently different and similar across tasks. Furthermore, multiple regression and variance partitioning analyses indicated that each task (i.e., other-reference, introspection, and memory) uniquely and jointly explained significant variances in mPFC activation during self-reference. These findings suggest that the self-reference task engages multiple cognitive processes shared with other tasks, with the mPFC serving as a crucial hub where essential information is integrated to support judgments based on internally constructed representations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Differential Beta and Gamma Activity Modulation during Unimanual and Bimanual Motor Learning</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e2187242025?rss=1</link><author>Wu, M., Schoenfeld, M.

This study aimed to investigate how beta and gamma activity differs between unimanual and bimanual movements and how these neural signatures evolve during the learning process. Our motor task incorporated varying levels of bimanual interaction: unimanual, bimanual-equal, and bimanual-unequal. Magnetoencephalography data were recorded in healthy participants ( = 43, 27 females) during task performance, and beta and gamma activity was quantified. As expected, increasing task complexity from unimanual to bimanual-equal and then to bimanual-unequal movements resulted in slower and less accurate performance. Across all conditions, significant beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) and gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed during movement, as well as beta ERS after movement. Bimanual movements exhibited greater beta ERD, beta ERS, and gamma ERS compared with unimanual movements. With practice, participants demonstrated faster and more accurate movements, accompanied by enhanced beta ERS responses. Furthermore, learning-related reductions in errors correlated with increases in beta ERS. These findings suggest the distinct behavioral and neural demands of unimanual versus bimanual movements and highlight the important role of beta activity in motor performance and learning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Statistical Context Learning in Visual Search: Distinct Electrophysiological Signatures of Contextual Guidance and Context Suppression</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e2186242025?rss=1</link><author>Chen (&amp;#x9648;&amp;#x601D;&amp;#x4F5A;), S., Merkus, N., Tsai (&amp;#x8521;&amp;#x52AD;&amp;#x626C;), S.-Y., Cheng (&amp;#x7A0B;&amp;#x601D;), S., Mu&amp;#x0308;ller, H.

Yet, real-world contexts vary in predictivity. We used electroencephalography (EEG) in human participants of either sex to explore how visual search facilitation arises from two distinct processing modes—contextual guidance and context suppression—that depend on the predictivity of distractor contexts, comparing repeated distractor arrangements that were either predictive or nonpredictive of target location against a baseline of nonrepeated arrangements. In Experiment 1, we manipulated context predictivity by shifting repeated contexts from predictive to nonpredictive and vice versa, while in Experiment 2, we restricted repeated contexts to one side of the display to assess lateralized effects of the two processing modes. Both types of contexts behaviorally facilitated visual search, but facilitation was larger with predictive contexts. Making predictive contexts nonpredictive reduced the facilitation while rendering nonpredictive contexts predictive failed to produce gains. Half-display predictive contexts facilitated target detection on both sides, while nonpredictive contexts facilitated same-side target detection only. EEG analyses revealed that predictive contexts triggered an early N1pc (guidance signal), followed by an enhanced N2pc (attentional selection) and an increased contralateral delay activity (CDA, indexing working memory processing of the target) in occipitoparietal regions, indicative of contextual guidance boosting the entire processing chain. In contrast, nonpredictive contexts produced only an increased N2pc accompanied by reduced CDA, consistent with context suppression. These differential patterns demonstrate contextual guidance and context suppression to operate as electrophysiologically distinct processing modes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Whole-Brain Dimensions of Intrinsic Connectivity Capture Modality-Specific and Heteromodal Language Representations</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e1876242025?rss=1</link><author>Marin-Marin, L., Eisenhauer, S., Gonzalez Alam, T.

While these have been localized to different regions, modality-selective responses extend beyond them, implicating large-scale network organization in language comprehension. Dimensions of whole-brain connectivity, derived from intrinsic activity, have been proposed as a general organizing framework for cognition. Here, we test their utility in accounting for the spatial distribution of task-evoked activity during language comprehension. We investigated brain activity in human males and females in response to psycholinguistic variables linked to input processing and meaning in a sentence comprehension task presented both visually and auditorily. Macroscale patterns of brain activity were similar across modalities for sentence-level and semantic variables, but effects of orthographic and phonological distance were negatively correlated between modalities. The first dimension, separating heteromodal and unimodal cortices, showed no differences across modalities for sentence processing and semantic variables and opposite effects of word length and orthographic/phonological distance for spoken and written words, supporting the notion that higher-order processing requires heteromodal resources different to those linked to input processing. The second dimension, separating auditory–motor and visual processes, showed an asymmetry in the recruitment of the unimodal systems—listening to long and semantically dissimilar words involved stronger recruitment of primary auditory–motor regions and low visual engagement. These findings show that the language system is organized according to large-scale axes of intrinsic connectivity, with psycholinguistic processes varying systematically along whole-brain dimensions. This supports the view that language comprehension reflects general principles of cortical organization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Multimodal MEG and Microstructure-MRI Investigations of the Human Hippocampal Scene Network</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e1700242025?rss=1</link><author>Read, M.-L., Hodgetts, C.

Here, combining electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography) and advanced microstructural (multishell diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative magnetization transfer) imaging in healthy human adults (30 females/10 males), we show that both theta power modulation of the hippocampus and fiber restriction/hindrance (reflecting axon packing/myelination) of the fornix (a major input/output pathway of the hippocampus) were independently related to scene, but not face, perceptual discrimination accuracy. Conversely, microstructural features of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (a long-range occipitoanterotemporal tract) correlated with face, but not scene, perceptual discrimination accuracy. Our results provide new mechanistic insight into the neurocognitive systems underpinning complex scene discrimination, providing novel support for the idea of multiple processing streams within the human medial temporal lobe.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neural and Behavioral Correlates of Individual Variability in Rat Helping Behavior: A Role for Social Affiliation and Oxytocin Receptors</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e0845242025?rss=1</link><author>Hazani, R., Breton, J.

While prosocial behavior is more frequently observed toward familiar conspecifics, even within the same social context, some individuals are more prone to help than others. In a rat helping behavior test where animals can release a distressed conspecific trapped inside a restrainer, most rats are motivated and consistently release the trapped rat ("openers"), yet ~30% do not open the restrainer ("nonopeners"). To characterize the difference between these populations, behavioral and neural markers were compared between opener and nonopener rats in males and females. Openers showed significantly more social affiliative behavior both before and after door opening compared with nonopeners. Oxytocin receptor mRNA levels were higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not the anterior insula, of openers. Several transcription control pathways were significantly upregulated in openers’ NAc. Chemogenetically inhibiting paraventricular oxytocin neurons did not significantly impair helping but reduced sociality measures, indicating that helping does not rely solely on oxytocin signaling. Analysis of brain-wide neural activity based on the immediate-early gene c-Fos in males revealed increased activity in openers in prosocial brain regions compared with nonopeners. These include regions associated with empathy in humans (insula, somatosensory, cingulate, and frontal cortices) and motivation and reward regions such as the NAc. These findings indicate that prosocial behavior may be predicted by affiliative behavior and activity in the prosocial neural network and provide targets for the investigation of causal mechanisms underlying prosocial behavior.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Single-Trial fMRI Decoding of 3D Motion with Stereoscopic and Perspective Cues</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/22/e0044252025?rss=1</link><author>Wen, P., Thompson, L.

We focused on the human motion complex (hMT+), extending insights from monkey studies. Using 3D-motion stimuli containing perspective and/or stereoscopic cues, we investigated the hierarchy within the motion complex in humans of both sexes to understand the neural mechanisms underlying motion perception. On each trial we decoded 3D motion direction (toward/away) based on the BOLD response in primary visual cortex (V1), and regions within hMT+ including the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas, and the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST). We found that 3D-motion direction could be reliably decoded from all four areas but accuracy depended on cue content. MT and FST showed greatest decoding accuracy with perspective and stereoscopic cues, respectively. Decoding of motion direction in V1 and MST could be explained by retinotopic biases in the BOLD response to motion stimuli. MT and FST were less impacted by such biases. We also identified significant behavioral differences between participants: some were proficient at using stereoscopic cues and others performed near chance. Good behavioral performance with stereoscopic cues was accompanied by better decoding performance in FST but not MT. A control experiment that eliminated 3D motion percepts for stereoscopic stimuli, but not perspective stimuli, revealed that unlike MT, decoding accuracy in FST was influenced by perceptual components of 3D motion. Our findings support that MT and FST play distinct roles in the analysis of visual motion and are key in the transformation of retinal input into perceptual report.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unpacking the dynamic role of physical effort in shaping behavior</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00111-1?rss=yes</link><author>Boris Cheval, Silvio Maltagliati, Florent Desplanques, Wanja Wolff</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><category>review</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.cell.com/archive?publicationCode=tics&amp;rss=yes">Trends in Cognitive Sciences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Effort plays a crucial role in shaping behavior. We propose that physical effort – and its perception – modulates people’s engagement across different stages of behavioral regulation: before, during, and after engagement. We demonstrate that individuals tend to avoid effort before engagement, minimize effort during task performance, and derive a sense of reward from effort after engagement due to an effort-justification mechanism. This dynamic and stage-specific approach moves beyond static models of effort (de)valuation, offering a more nuanced understanding of how effort shapes behavior. Focusing on physical activity, we explore how these specific effort-related mechanisms could promote physical activity by fostering conditions where individuals engage in active behaviors because of the potential rewards effort brings, despite its associated cost.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Quantification of the effect of hemodynamic occlusion in two-photon imaging of mouse cortex</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/104914</link><author>Rebecca Jordan</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The last few years have seen an explosion in the number of tools available to measure neuronal activity using fluorescence imaging (Chen et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2019; Jing et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2021). When performed in vivo, these measurements are invariably contaminated by hemodynamic occlusion artifacts. In widefield calcium imaging, this problem is well recognized. For two-photon imaging, however, the effects of hemodynamic occlusion have only been sparsely characterized. Here, we perform a quantification of hemodynamic occlusion effects using measurements of fluorescence changes observed with GFP expression using both widefield and two-photon imaging in mouse cortex. We find that in many instances the magnitude of signal changes attributable to hemodynamic occlusion is comparable to that observed with activity sensors. Moreover, we find that hemodynamic occlusion effects were spatially heterogeneous, both over cortical regions and across cortical depth, and exhibited a complex relationship with behavior. Thus, hemodynamic occlusion is an important caveat to consider when analyzing and interpreting not just widefield but also two-photon imaging data.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Did you see it?</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/107246</link><author>Ling Liu</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cautious reporting choices can artificially enhance how well analyses of brain activity reflect conscious and unconscious experiences, making distinguishing between the two more challenging.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/102335</link><author>Timo Stein</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How consciousness arises from brain activity has been a topic of intense scientific research for decades. But how does one identify the neural basis of something that is intrinsically personal and subjective? A hallmark approach has been to ask human observers to judge stimuli as ‘seen’ (conscious) and ‘unseen’ (unconscious) and use post hoc sorting of neural measurements based these judgments. Unfortunately, cognitive and response biases are known to strongly affect how observers place their criterion for judging stimuli as ‘seen’ versus ‘unseen’, thereby confounding neural measures of consciousness. Surprisingly however, the effect of conservative and liberal criterion placement on neural measures of unconscious and conscious processing has never been explicitly investigated. Here, we use simulations and electrophysiological brain measurements to show that conservative criterion placement has an unintuitive consequence: rather than selectively providing a cautious estimate of conscious processing, it inflates effect sizes in neural measures of both conscious and unconscious processing, while liberal criterion placement does the reverse. After showing this in simulation, we performed decoding analyses on two electroencephalography studies that employ common subjective indicators of conscious awareness, in which we experimentally manipulated the response criterion. The results confirm that the predicted confounding effects of criterion placement on neural measures of unconscious and conscious processing occur in empirical data, while further showing that the most widely used subjective scale, the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS), does not guard against criterion confounds. Follow-up simulations explicate how the experimental context determines whether the relative confounding effect of criterion placement is larger in neural measures of either conscious or unconscious processing. We conclude that criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of conscious and unconscious processing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Endogenous oscillatory rhythms and interactive contingencies jointly influence infant attention during early infant-caregiver interaction</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/88775</link><author>Sam V Wass</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost all early cognitive development takes place in social contexts. At the moment, however, we know little about the neural and micro-interactive mechanisms that support infants’ attention during social interactions. Recording EEG during naturalistic caregiver-infant interactions (N=66), we compare two different accounts. Traditional, didactic perspectives emphasise the role of the caregiver in structuring the interaction, whilst active learning models focus on motivational factors, endogenous to the infant, that guide their attention. Our results show that, already by 12 months, intrinsic cognitive processes control infants’ attention: fluctuations in endogenous oscillatory neural activity associated with changes in infant attentiveness. In comparison, infant attention was not forwards-predicted by caregiver gaze or vocal behaviours. Instead, caregivers rapidly modulated their behaviours in response to changes in infant attention and cognitive engagement, and greater reactive changes associated with longer infant attention. Our findings suggest that shared attention develops through interactive but asymmetric, infant-led processes that operate across the caregiver-child dyad.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Automated quality control of T1-weighted brain MRI scans for clinical research datasets: methods comparison and design of a quality prediction classifier</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.4/130632/Automated-quality-control-of-T1-weighted-brain-MRI</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Charting the path in rodent functional neuroimaging</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.12/130659/Charting-the-path-in-rodent-functional</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Organization of distributed cortical connections underlying the processing of auditory information in dogs assessed by diffusion MRI</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.16/130697/Organization-of-distributed-cortical-connections</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neurophysiological mechanisms of focused attention meditation: A scoping systematic review</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.14/130698/Neurophysiological-mechanisms-of-focused-attention</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Task demands shape network interactions during reading and visual form processing</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.13/130699/Task-demands-shape-network-interactions-during</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brain-wide associations of reaction time variability in the ABCD study</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.18/130766/Brain-wide-associations-of-reaction-time</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Long COVID-related blood-brain barrier breakdown and microstructure in older adults are modified by sex and Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.23/130857/Long-COVID-related-blood-brain-barrier-breakdown</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neural Electrical Correlates of Subjective Happiness</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70224?af=R</link><author>Wataru Sato,  Takanori Kochiyama,  Shota Uono</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 12:19:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We investigated neural electrical correlates of subjective happiness by analyzing resting-state magnetoencephalography and measures of subjective happiness. Gamma-band lower spontaneous neural fluctuation values in the right precuneus were associated with higher subjective happiness scores. These findings suggest that gamma-band activity in the precuneus implements subjective happiness.Happiness is a subjective experience that can serve as the ultimate goal for humans. A recent study that employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reported that spontaneous fluctuation (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation: fALFF) in the precuneus is negatively associated with subjective happiness. However, little is known about the neural electrical correlates of subjective happiness, which can provide direct evidence of neural activity and insights regarding the underlying psychological, cellular, and neurotransmitter mechanisms. Therefore, we measured 400-channel whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) during resting state in participants whose subjective happiness was evaluated using questionnaires. We conducted source reconstruction analysis utilizing bandpass-filtered MEG data and analyzed the fALFF of the band-limited power time series as an index of spontaneous neural fluctuation. Gamma-band fALFF values in the right precuneus were negatively associated with subjective happiness scores (partial correlation coefficient = −0.56). These findings indicate that subjective happiness has a neural electrical correlate of reduced spontaneous fluctuation of gamma-band neuronal oscillations in the right precuneus, and that it could be mediated by a reduction in wandering, clinging self-consciousness through heightened -methyl--aspartate-dependent gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic parvalbumin inhibitory interneuron activity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neurometabolite Alterations Associated With Cannabis Use: A Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Meta‐Analysis</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70236?af=R</link><author>Anna E.

Using meta-analytic modeling of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies, this study aimed to assess the differences in brain metabolite levels associated with cannabis use (PROSPERO: CRD42020209890) to inform treatment development for cannabis use disorder (CUD). Hedge's  with random-effects modeling was used, and heterogeneity and publication bias indices were assessed. A complete literature search was conducted, and 15 studies met the inclusion criteria (e.g., 1H-MRS, cannabis group compared to a control group, brain region-specific results, necessary data to complete modeling). There were 29 models across gray matter regions in the brain. All models had between 2 and 5 studies (), indicating that results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of available studies. Compared to the control groups, the cannabis-using groups showed lower levels of GABA and N-acetylaspartate in the anterior cingulate cortex ( = 3); lower glutamate in the basal ganglia/striatum ( = 2); and lower glutamine and -inositol in the thalamus ( = 2; although the two effect sizes came from the same sample).

In this fMRI study, we explore the neural substrates supporting efficient inhibition control and examine whether the typical right lateralization of IFG activation can be modulated by stimulus properties (semantic features) and inhibitory demand (reaction times, RT). We chose a Go/No-Go lexical decision task, utilizing concrete and abstract words as Go stimuli and pseudo-word as No-Go stimuli. Behavioral results reveal that inhibition is more effective during concrete word sessions compared to abstract word sessions, suggesting a modulation of cognitive inhibition by semantic features. Neuroimaging results further demonstrate that successful inhibition activates bilateral IFG, indicating a flexible right lateralization pattern of IFG activation that varies with stimulus properties. To examine how varying inhibitory demands modulate neural activation patterns, we reclassified concrete and abstract sessions into fast and slow sessions based on RT, followed by within-group comparisons. Our study highlights the crucial role of the bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) in efficient inhibition, with increased activation associated with rapid response inhibition. Furthermore, we report enhanced neural coupling between the right IFG and multiple functionally connected regions, including bilateral insula, putamen, and pallidum, as well as between the right middle frontal gyrus and other prefrontal regions during rapid inhibitory responses, whereas no engagement of the left IFG was observed in efficient inhibition. These findings imply a hierarchical functional organization of the bilateral fronto-basal ganglia circuits, in which the right prefrontal regions play a dominant role in inhibition control, supported by basal ganglia regions, while the left IFG may serve a supplementary function. Stimulus properties can modulate right lateralization, underscoring the dynamic and flexible nature of the prefrontal-basal ganglia network in inhibition control.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Functional Connectivity Patterns Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and the Association With Longitudinal Cognitive Function</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70237?af=R</link><author>Goretti España‐Irla,  Emma M.

These connectivity changes are associated with cognitive performance over 12 months, highlighting both detrimental and adaptive neuroplastic changes in response to injury.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revealed subtle neuroplastic changes in brain networks following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), even when standard clinical imaging fails to detect abnormalities. However, prior findings have been inconsistent, in part due to methodological differences and high researcher degrees of freedom in region-based analyses, which often rely on predefined hypotheses and overlook complex, distributed connectivity patterns. Here, we apply an unbiased, data-driven multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine whole-brain functional connectivity differences in a large cohort of individuals with acute mTBI. Unlike conventional statistical approaches, MVPA enables a data-driven analysis of brain-wide connectivity patterns without requiring prior assumptions about the location or nature of abnormalities, allowing for the identification of the most informative features. This approach provides an exploratory characterization of whole-brain functional connectivity patterns and their relationship with cognitive recovery, offering new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying post-injury outcomes. A total of 265 adults (87 women) between 18 and 83 years old with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 13–15 were included in this analysis. Two replicate samples ( = 165,  = 155), with similar demographic characteristics, were also included. Data were collected as part of the prospective multi-center Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI). The goal of this study was to assess whole-brain functional connectivity patterns using fc-MVPA and post hoc seed-to-voxel analyses in a large, well-characterized sample to determine if changes in functional connectivity can differentiate subacute mTBI (within 2 weeks of injury) from a matched group of orthopedic control subjects ( = 49). Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether these connectivity patterns were linked to cognitive performance at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-injury to better understand cognitive trajectories and recovery over time in individuals with mTBI. Voxel-to-voxel functional connectivity across the entire connectome revealed significant differences between TBI and no TBI in the functional connectivity patterns of 8 clusters (-voxel < 0.001, FEW cluster-level  < 0.05) ( > 40, Fmax = 15.36), including right occipital cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior and middle temporal gyrus, right thalamus, left cerebellum, and the bilateral frontal pole. These clusters belong mainly to the visual network (VIS), frontoparietal network (FPN), default mode network (DMN) and limbic network (LIM). Post hoc characterization of each significant cluster revealed by MVPA using seed-to-voxel analysis showed a mixed pattern of connectivity between relevant networks and subcortico-cortical connections. After connectivity characterization, visual-motor skills assessed with Trail Making Test (TMT) A were significantly associated with the increased anticorrelation between the inferior temporal cortex and the bilateral occipital pole (FPN-VIS connectivity), along with decreased anticorrelations between the cerebellum and extensive areas of the somatomotor network (SMN) over 12 months post injury. Additionally, hypoconnectivity between the frontal pole (LIM) and anterior cingulate gyrus (salience network [SAL]) was associated with better executive functions performance measured by TMT-B over 12 months post-mTBI. In our study examining neuroplastic changes following TBI across the entire voxel-to-voxel functional connectome, we identified significant differences in the functional connectivity patterns of several regions known to be particularly vulnerable to injury mechanisms. Our findings highlight the complex and compensatory nature of brain network alterations after mTBI, suggesting both detrimental and adaptive changes in connectivity that affect cognitive functions. Consequently, our study provides novel evidence that specific brain networks and regions are particularly susceptible to functional connectivity changes during the acute stages of mTBI, which are related to cognitive recovery post-injury.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are There Really People With No Inner Voice?

Mammals have 10 KvS subunits: Kv5.1 (), Kv6.1 (), Kv6.2 (), Kv6.3 (), Kv6.4 (), Kv8.1 (), Kv8.2 (), Kv9.1 (), Kv9.2 (), and Kv9.3 (). Electrically excitable cells broadly express channels containing Kv2 subunits and most neurons have substantial Kv2 conductance. However, whether KvS subunits contribute to these conductances has not been clear, leaving the physiological roles of KvS subunits poorly understood. Here, we identify that two potent Kv2 inhibitors, used in combination, can distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers and Kv2-only channels. We find that Kv5, Kv6, Kv8, or Kv9-containing channels are resistant to the Kv2-selective pore-blocker RY785 yet remain sensitive to the Kv2-selective voltage sensor modulator guangxitoxin-1E (GxTX). Using these inhibitors in mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons, we find predominantly RY785-sensitive conductances consistent with channels composed entirely of Kv2 subunits. In contrast, RY785-resistant but GxTX-sensitive conductances consistent with Kv2/KvS heteromeric channels predominate in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion neurons. These results establish an approach to pharmacologically distinguish conductances of Kv2/KvS heteromers from Kv2-only channels, enabling investigation of the physiological roles of endogenous KvS subunits. These findings suggest that drugs which distinguish KvS subunits could modulate electrical activity of subsets of Kv2-expressing cell types.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An antisense oligonucleotide-based strategy to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/103328</link><author>Yijing Chen</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adults and children with the 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome demonstrate cognitive, social, and emotional impairments and high risk for schizophrenia. Work in mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion provided compelling evidence for abnormal expression and processing of microRNAs. A major transcriptional effect of the microRNA dysregulation is upregulation of  a component of the ER membrane complex, which promotes membrane insertion of a subset of polytopic and tail-anchored membrane proteins. We previously uncovered a key contribution of EMC10 in mediating the behavioral phenotypes observed in 22q11.2 deletion mouse models. Here, we show that expression and processing of miRNAs is abnormal and  expression is elevated in neurons derived from 22q11.2 deletion carriers. Reduction of  restores defects in neurite outgrowth and calcium signaling in patient neurons. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotide administration and normalization of  in the adult mouse brain not only alleviates cognitive deficits in social and spatial memory but remarkably sustains these improvements for over 2 months post-injection, indicating its therapeutic potential. Broadly, our study integrates findings from both animal models and human neurons to elucidate the translational potential of modulating  levels and downstream targets as a specific venue to ameliorate disease progression in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Integration of head and body orientations in the macaque superior temporal sulcus is stronger for upright bodies</title><link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/105714</link><author>Yordanka Zafirova</author><category>journal</category><category>general</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://elifesciences.org/">eLife</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The neural processing of faces and bodies is often studied separately, despite their natural integration in perception. Unlike prior research on the neural selectivity for either head or body orientation, we investigated their interaction in macaque superior temporal sulcus (STS) using a monkey avatar with diverse head–body orientation angles. STS neurons showed selectivity for specific combinations of head–body orientations. Anterior STS (aSTS) neurons enabled more reliable decoding of head–body configuration angles compared to middle STS neurons. Decoding accuracy in aSTS was lowest for head–body angle pairs differing only in sign (e.g. head–body orientation difference of ±90° relative to the anatomical midline), and highest for aligned (0°) head–body orientations versus those with maximum angular difference. Inverted bodies showed diminished decoding of head–body orientation angle compared to upright bodies. These findings show that aSTS integrates head and body orientation cues, revealing configuration-specific neural mechanisms, and advance our understanding of social perception.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A high-dimensional model of social impressions</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00110-X?rss=yes</link><author>Jonathan B.

We argue that these dimensions, rather than reflecting intrinsic mechanisms, emerge from adaptive visuo-semantic processes in a high-dimensional neural-state space. Drawing on attractor neural-network models, we propose a framework treating social impressions as dynamic trajectories that stabilize over time, influenced not only by visual cues but also by conceptual associations and higher-order social cognition. Unlike low-dimensional models, this framework can account for cultural, individual, and situational factors that shape impressions. A high-dimensional framework makes several novel predictions and can offer a more accurate and complete understanding of the fluidity and complexity of social perception.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Long-term elevated levels of loneliness are linked to lower health-related quality of life in middle-aged Australian women</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00264-z</link><author>Ding Ding</author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://feeds.nature.com/commspsychol/rss/current">Communications Psychology</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A latent class analysis of long-term loneliness patterns over 18 years found consistent associations with physical and mental health-related quality of life in middle-aged and older women, emphasising the need to address loneliness to improve women’s health and well-being.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The influence of mental state attributions on trust in large language models</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00262-1</link><author>Stephen M.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal data are presented together with analysis of factors influencing image noise, contrast, and distortions.The lower infrastructure requirements of portable ultra-low field MRI (ULF-MRI) systems have enabled their use in diverse settings such as intensive care units and remote medical facilities. The UNITY Project is an international neuroimaging network harnessing this technology, deploying portable ULF-MRI systems globally to expand access to MRI for studies into brain development. Given the wide range of environments where ULF-MRI systems may operate, there are external factors that might influence image quality. This work aims to introduce the quality control (QC) framework used by the UNITY Project to investigate how robust the systems are and how QC metrics compare between sites and over time. We present a QC framework using a commercially available phantom, scanned with 64 mT portable MRI systems at 17 sites across 12 countries on four continents. Using automated, open-source analysis tools, we quantify signal-to-noise, image contrast, and geometric distortions. Our results demonstrated that the image quality is robust to the varying operational environment, for example, electromagnetic noise interference and temperature. The Larmor frequency was significantly correlated to room temperature, as was image noise and contrast. Image distortions were less than 2.5 mm, with high robustness over time. Similar to studies at higher field, we found that changes in pulse sequence parameters from software updates had an impact on QC metrics. This study demonstrates that portable ULF-MRI systems can be deployed in a variety of environments for multi-center neuroimaging studies and produce robust results.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Correction for Fernandez Velasco et al., Expert navigators deploy rational complexity–based decision precaching for large-scale real-world planning</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2509414122?af=R</link><author></author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.pnas.org/action/doSearch?af=R">PNAS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 21, May 2025. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Correction for Clark et al., Prosocial motives underlie scientific censorship by scientists: A perspective and research agenda</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2510676122?af=R</link><author></author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.pnas.org/action/doSearch?af=R">PNAS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 22, June 2025. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ideological alignment determines whether protest action is considered acceptable</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-025-00459-5</link><author>Jenn Richler</author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>review</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://feeds.nature.com/nrpsychol/rss/current">Nature Reviews Psychology</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ideological alignment determines whether protest action is considered acceptable]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>On analogies in vertebrate and insect visual systems</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00932-3</link><author>Ruben Portugues</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><category>review</category><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://feeds.nature.com/nrn/rss/current">Nature Reviews Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The visual systems of vertebrates and insects exhibit considerable similarities.

In , Commissureless (Comm) plays a critical role in this process; however, there is conflicting data on the underlying molecular mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved PY motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of Comm are required allow the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of Robo1. Disruption of these motifs prevents Comm from localizing to Lamp1 positive late endosomes and to promote axon growth across the midline in vivo. In addition, we conclusively demonstrate a role for Nedd4 in midline crossing. Genetic analysis shows that  mutations result in midline crossing defects in the  embryonic nerve cord, which can be rescued by introduction of exogenous Nedd4. Biochemical evidence shows that Nedd4 incorporates into a three-member complex with Comm and Robo1 in a PY motif-dependent manner. Finally, we present genetic evidence that Nedd4 acts with Comm in the embryonic nerve cord to downregulate Robo1 levels. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Comm promotes midline crossing in the nerve cord by facilitating Robo1 ubiquitination by Nedd4, ultimately leading to its degradation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What We Think Others Think and Do About Climate Change: A Multicountry Test of Pluralistic Ignorance and Public-Consensus Messaging</title><link>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976251335585?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R</link><author>Sandra J.

Although functional heterogeneity within the VS has been well established in rodents, its relevance and mechanisms in primates remain unclear. To address this issue, we performed bilateral pharmacological inactivation of the VS in two male macaque monkeys using muscimol, a GABA receptor agonist. Precise targeting was achieved through computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral effects were evaluated using two methods: a goal-directed task with variable rewards and analysis of spontaneous behavior. Our results demonstrated that anterior (a)VS inactivation induced a hypoactivity state that we termed "resting," whereas posterior (p)VS inactivation elicited compulsive-like "checking" behaviors. Notably, neither the aVS nor the pVS inactivation affected reward value or drive processing, thus differentiating aVS and pVS from those involved in incentive motivation, such as the rostromedial caudate and ventral pallidum. Retrograde tracing demonstrated distinct anatomical projection patterns for the aVS and pVS, supporting their functional segregation. Together, the present results suggest the functional heterogeneity of the primate VS along its anterior–posterior axis, with the aVS and pVS participating in distinct motivational control circuits. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and for the development of new therapeutic approaches.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EEG of the Dancing Brain: Decoding Sensory, Motor, and Social Processes during Dyadic Dance</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e2372242025?rss=1</link><author>Bigand, F., Bianco, R., Abalde, S.

Interpreting neural activity in such ecological conditions remains a key challenge for neuroscience. This study leverages advancements in denoising techniques and multivariate modeling to extract interpretable EEG signals from pairs of (male and/or female) participants engaged in spontaneous dyadic dance. Using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), we investigated how music acoustics, self-generated kinematics, other-generated kinematics, and social coordination uniquely contributed to EEG activity. Electromyogram recordings from ocular, face, and neck muscles were also modeled to control for artifacts. The mTRFs effectively disentangled neural signals associated with four processes: (I) auditory tracking of music, (II) control of self-generated movements, (III) visual monitoring of partner movements, and (IV) visual tracking of social coordination. We show that the first three neural signals are driven by event-related potentials: the P50-N100-P200 triggered by acoustic events, the central lateralized movement-related cortical potentials triggered by movement initiation, and the occipital N170 triggered by movement observation. Notably, the (previously unknown) neural marker of social coordination encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, surpassing the encoding of self- or partner-related kinematics taken alone. This marker emerges when partners can see each other, exhibits a topographical distribution over occipital areas, and is specifically driven by movement observation rather than initiation. Using data-driven kinematic decomposition, we further show that vertical bounce movements best drive observers’ EEG activity. These findings highlight the potential of real-world neuroimaging, combined with multivariate modeling, to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex yet natural social behaviors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timing of Speech in Brain and Glottis and the Feedback Delay Problem in Motor Control</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e2294242025?rss=1</link><author>Veillette, J.

This matching problem would be simple if motor neuron output led to sensory feedback with a fixed, predictable lag. However, nonlinear dynamics in the brain and the body's periphery can decouple the timing of critical events from that of the motor output which caused them. During human speech production, for example, phonation from the glottis (a sound source for speech) begins suddenly when subglottal pressure and laryngeal tension cross a sharp threshold (i.e., a bifurcation). Only if the brain can predict the timing of these discrete peripheral events resulting from motor output, then, would it be possible to match sensory feedback to movements based on temporal coherence. We show that event onsets in the (male and female) human glottal waveform, measured using electroglottography, are reflected in the electroencephalogram during speech production, leading up to the time of the event itself. Conversely, glottal event times can be decoded from the electroencephalogram. After prolonged exposure to delayed auditory feedback, subjects recalibrate their behavioral threshold for detecting temporal auditory–motor mismatches and decoded event times decouple from actual movements. This suggests decoding performance is driven by plastic predictions of peripheral timing, providing a missing component for hindsight credit assignment, in which specific feedback events are associated with the neural activity that gave rise to movements. We discuss parallel findings from the birdsong system suggesting that results may generalize across vocal learning species.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Evidence That Respiratory Phase May Modulate Task-Related Neural Representations of Visual Stimuli</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e2236242025?rss=1</link><author>Stetza, L., Hehemann, L., Kayser, C.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 16:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We investigate how respiration influences cognition by examining the interaction between respiratory phase and task-related brain activity during two visual categorization tasks. While prior research shows that cognitive performance varies along the respiratory cycle, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Though some studies have shown that large-scale neural activity reflecting for example changes in the excitation–inhibition balance is comodulated with the respiratory cycle, it remains unclear whether respiration directly shapes the neural signatures reflecting the encoding of task-specific external signals. We address this gap by applying single-trial multivariate analyses to EEG data obtained in humans ( = 25, any gender), allowing us to track how respiration relates to the sensory evidence reflected in this neurophysiological signal. Confirming previous studies, our data show that participant's performance varies with the respiratory phase prior and during a trial. Importantly, they suggest that respiration may directly influence the sensory evidence carried by neurophysiological processes emerging ~300–200 ms prior to participant's responses. Hence, respiration and sensory-cognitive processes are not only highly intertwined but respiration may directly facilitate the representation of behaviorally relevant signals in the brain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learning Modulates Early Encephalographic Responses to Distracting Stimuli: A Combined SSVEP and ERP Study</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e1973242025?rss=1</link><author>Duncan, D.

However, the neural mechanism underlying learned suppression remains largely unknown. In this study, we combined steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) with event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the mechanism behind statistically learned spatial suppression. Twenty-four male and female human participants performed a version of the additional singleton search task in which one location contained a distractor stimulus frequently. The search stimuli constantly flickered on-and-off the screen, resulting in steady-state entrainment. Prior to search onset, no differences in the SSVEP response were found, though a post hoc analysis did reveal proactive alpha lateralization. Following search onset, clear evoked differences in both the SSVEP and ERP signals emerged at the suppressed location relative to all other locations. Crucially, the early timing of these evoked modulations suggests that learned distractor suppression occurs at the initial stages of visual processing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neocortical and Hippocampal Theta Oscillations Track Audiovisual Integration and Replay of Speech Memories</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e1797242025?rss=1</link><author>Biau, E., Wang, D., Park, H., Jensen, O., Hanslmayr, S.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 16:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Are you talkin’ to me?!" If you ever watched the masterpiece "Taxi Driver" directed by Martin Scorsese, you certainly recall the monologue during which Travis Bickle rehearses an imaginary confrontation in front of a mirror. While remembering this scene, you recollect a myriad of speech features across visual and auditory senses with a smooth sensation of unified memory. The aim of this study was to investigate how the fine-grained synchrony between coinciding visual and auditory features impacts brain oscillations when forming multisensory speech memories. We developed a memory task presenting participants with short synchronous or asynchronous movie clips focused on the face of speakers in real interviews, all the while undergoing magnetoencephalography recording. In the synchronous condition, the natural alignment between visual and auditory onsets was kept intact. In the asynchronous condition, auditory onsets were delayed to present lip movements and speech sounds in antiphase specifically with respect to the theta oscillation synchronizing them in the original movie. Our results first showed that theta oscillations in the neocortex and hippocampus were modulated by the level of synchrony between lip movements and syllables during audiovisual speech perception. Second, theta asynchrony between the lip movements and auditory envelope during audiovisual speech perception reduced the accuracy of subsequent theta oscillation reinstatement during memory recollection. We conclude that neural theta oscillations play a pivotal role in both audiovisual integration and memory replay of speech.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Optogenetic Stimulation of Novel Tph2-Cre Rats Advances Insight into Serotonin&apos;s Role in Locomotion, Reinforcement, and Compulsivity</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e1424242025?rss=1</link><author>Robke, R., Sansi, F., Arbab, T., Tunez, A., Moore, M., Bartsch, D., Scho&amp;#x0308;nig, K., Willuhn, I.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 16:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Serotonin critically modulates the activity of many brain networks, including circuits that control motivation and responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli. Furthermore, the serotonin system is targeted by first-line pharmacological treatments for several psychiatric disorders, including obsessive–compulsive disorder. However, understanding the behavioral function of serotonin is hampered by methodological limitations: the (brainstem) location of serotonergic neuron cell-bodies is difficult to access, their innervation of the brain is diffuse, and they release serotonin in relatively low concentrations. Here, we advance this effort by developing novel Tph2-Cre rats, which we utilized to study serotonin in the context of motor, compulsive, and reinforced behaviors using optogenetics in both male and female rats. Specificity and sensitivity of Cre recombinase expression and Cre-dependent processes were validated immunohistochemically, and optogenetic induction of in vivo serotonin release was validated with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Optogenetic stimulation of serotonin neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus did not initiate locomotion or alter aversion-induced locomotion, nor did it elicit (real-time) place preference, and it had no measurable effect on compulsive behavior in the schedule-induced polydipsia task. In contrast, this optogenetic stimulation moderately sustained ongoing spontaneous locomotion and robustly reinforced operant lever pressing for self-stimulation of serotonin neurons, which was exacerbated by food restriction. Together, this work both introduces a novel rat Cre line to study serotonin and advances our understanding of serotonin's behavioral functions. Complementing previous findings, we find that brainwide serotonin release has an overall relatively mild effect on behavior, which manifested only in the absence of natural reinforcers and was modulated by physiological state.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Differentiating Reinforcement Learning and Episodic Memory in Value-Based Decisions in Parkinson&apos;s Disease</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/21/e0911242025?rss=1</link><author>Montaser-Kouhsari, L., Nicholas, J., Gerraty, R.

It is typically assumed that this impairment reflects a loss of striatal dopamine. However, many open questions remain about the nature of reward-based learning deficits in PD. Recent studies have found that even simple reward-based learning tasks rely on a combination of cognitive and computational strategies, including one-shot episodic memory. These findings raise questions about how incremental learning and episodic memory contribute to decision-making in PD. We tested healthy participants ( = 26; 14 males and 12 females) and patients with PD ( = 26; 16 males and 10 females), both on- and off-dopamine replacement medication, on a task designed to differentiate between the contributions of incremental learning and episodic memory to reward-based learning and decision-making. We found that PD patients performed equally well as healthy controls when using episodic memory but were impaired at incremental reward-based learning. Dopamine replacement medication remediated this deficit and enhanced subsequent episodic memory for the value of motivationally relevant stimuli. These results demonstrate that while PD patients are impaired at learning about reward from trial-and-error, their ability to encode memories for the value of one-shot experiences is intact.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Structural Connectivity Differences Reflect Microstructural Heterogeneity of the Human Insular Cortex</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70231?af=R</link><author>Julian Quabs,  Nora Bittner,  Svenja Caspers</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 12:59:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Combining the microstructural JulichBrain Atlas with tractography, we analyzed connectivity patterns within the cytoarchitecture of the human insula.

Additional whole-brain connectivity analyses reveal that two distinct areas within the anterior (Id6) and posterior (Id3) human insula may serve as integrative hubs, mediating between higher-order cognitive and limbic systems, as well as across sensory modalities.The insular cortex is renowned for its multitude of functions, intricate structural connectivity patterns, and complex cytoarchitecture, yet a unified multimodal concept remains elusive. Microstructural parcellations provide a promising mediator to integrate connectome data into a combined structural–functional framework. While in the macaque insula, a clear relationship between anatomical connections and cytoarchitecture is well established, such correlation in the human insula remains unclear. By combining diffusion data from two large cohorts, including 914 and 204 subjects, respectively, as well as probabilistic tractography and the microstructural JulichBrain Atlas, we uncover how microstructural diversity reflects structural connectivity patterns in the human insula. Analyzing the connectivity of 16 cytoarchitectonic areas, we identified six clusters, two in the posterior and four in the anterior insula. Posterior clusters exhibited strong connectivity with temporal, occipital, and parietal areas encompassing auditory, visual, and somatosensory systems. Conversely, anterior clusters were specifically linked with (orbito)frontal areas, such as Broca's area or frontal opercular areas. Together, our data demonstrate that structural connectivity differences are reflected by fundamental principles of microstructural organization in the human insula. Additional whole-brain connectivity analyses reveal that two distinct areas within the anterior (Id6) and posterior (Id3) human insula may serve as integrative hubs, mediating between higher-order cognitive and limbic systems, as well as across sensory modalities. All clusters are openly available in MNI space to support future multimodal studies addressing the relations between cytoarchitecture, structure, functions, and pathologies in this complex region of the human neocortex.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neurophysiological Progression in Alzheimer&apos;s Disease: Insights From Dynamic Causal Modelling of Longitudinal Magnetoencephalography</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70234?af=R</link><author>Amirhossein Jafarian,  Melek Karadag Assem,  Ece Kocagoncu,  Juliette H.

Our DCM incorporates region-specific contributions of cortical laminar activities to accommodate variability in disease burden across brain regions. We introduce dual parameterization of neurotransmission mechanisms in DCM to distinguish between AD's effects on different receptor types. Bayesian group-level analysis reveals regional specificity of AD effects, highlighting selective NMDA neurotransmission changes and progressive connectivity alterations within and between the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex. Changes in effective connectivity correlate with individual differences in cognitive decline during follow-up, suggesting potential as a biomarker for AD progression.Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, are characterised by selective neuronal vulnerability with regional, laminar, cellular and neurotransmitter specificity. The regional losses of neurons and their synapses are associated with neurophysiological changes and cognitive decline. Hypotheses related to these mechanisms can be tested and compared by dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of human neuroimaging data, including magnetoencephalography (MEG). In this paper, we use DCM of cross-spectral densities to model changes between baseline and follow-up data in cortical regions of the default mode network, to characterise longitudinal changes in cortical microcircuits and their connectivity underlying resting-state MEG. Twenty-nine people with amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease early dementia were studied at baseline and after an average interval of 16 months. To study longitudinal changes induced by Alzheimer's disease, we evaluate three complementary sets of DCM: (i) with regional specificity, of the contributions of neurons to measurements to accommodate regional variability in disease burden; (ii) with dual parameterisation of excitatory neurotransmission, motivated by preclinical and clinical evidence of distinct effects of disease on AMPA versus NMDA type glutamate receptors; and (iii) with constraints to test specific clinical hypothesis about the effects of disease-progression. Bayesian model selection at the group level confirmed evidence for regional specificity of the effects of Alzheimer's disease, with evidence for selective changes in NMDA neurotransmission, and progressive changes in connectivity within and between Precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, alterations in effective connectivity vary in accordance with individual differences in cognitive decline during follow-up. These applications of DCM enrich the mechanistic understanding of the pathophysiology of human Alzheimer's disease and inform experimental medicine studies of novel therapies. More generally, longitudinal DCM provides a potential platform for natural history and interventional studies of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, with selective neuronal vulnerability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The ubiquity of episodic-like memory during infancy</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00082-8?rss=yes</link><author>Lillian Behm, Nicholas B.

However, much of this research pre-dates contemporary theories of memory systems in the mature brain. This review provides a refresher on these conceptual frameworks and proposes a common theoretical foundation for reconciling adult and infant studies. This foundation enables a critical analysis of infant studies that have directly tested memory and suggests that they may not capture the full nature and extent of episodic memory abilities in infancy. The analysis is extended to infant studies that are ostensibly focused on cognitive domains other than memory and finds that many such tasks require episodic-like memory. Thus, there may be substantially more evidence for episodic-like memory in infants than previously recognized.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An extended and improved CCFv3 annotation and Nissl atlas of the entire mouse brain</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00565/128850/An-extended-and-improved-CCFv3-annotation-and</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Demonstrating equivalence across magnetoencephalography scanner platforms using neural fingerprinting</title><link>https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/IMAG.a.10/130661/Demonstrating-equivalence-across</link><author>editor@direct.mit.edu/imag</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://direct.mit.edu/imag">Imaging Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DLPFC: The Decade circLe CCNP Family Cohort</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02131-1</link><author></author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.nature.com/subjects/social-neuroscience">Social neuroscience series</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Empirically Integrating the Evidence for Different Predictive Coding Components Using Auditory False Perception</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70211?af=R</link><author>Feifan Chen,  Anusha Yasoda‐Mohan,  Colum Ó Sé,  Sven Vanneste</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 12:58:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This study integratively measured the independent components of the predictive coding system including priors, confidence, prediction errors (PEs) and perceptual inference. The results showed that subjects with higher confidence in priors are more likely to shape perception towards prior belief and are more sensitive to context-driven PEs.Perception is a probabilistic estimation of the sensory information we receive at any given time and is shaped by an internal model generated by the brain by assimilating information over the life course. This predictive system in the brain has several components–(i) the internal model, (ii) the model-based prediction called priors, (iii) the weighted difference between the prior and sensory input called prediction error (PE) and (iv) the weighted sum of the prior and input called perceptual inference. Until now, different studies have explored the independent components of this predictive coding system, and we, for the first time to our knowledge, integrate them. To do this, we induce a conditioned hallucination (CH) illusion by means of a multisensory integration paradigm and use this as a model to study the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to this experience. Additionally, we also probe their predictive coding system using a well-established local–global auditory oddball paradigm. By comparing the behavioral and electrophysiological components of people more and less likely to perceive an illusion in the two paradigms, we observed that high perceivers place more confidence in their internal model and low perceivers in the sensory information. Furthermore, high perceivers were more sensitive than low perceivers to PEs that were generated by a change in the context of the sensory information, which served as a measure of a change in the internal model itself. As an exploratory analysis, we also observed that the objective likelihood of perceiving an illusion was corrected to the self-reported likelihood of perceiving an illusion in a day-to-day setting, which disappears when controlled for the perceptual threshold. These results taken together start to give us an idea as to how a person's innate bias—either towards a learned model or external information may—affect their perception in a sensory context.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Consequences of Bilingual Language Coactivation for Higher Order Cognition</title><link>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09637214251339455?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R</link><author>Viorica Marian, Sayuri Hayakawa</author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>review</category><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 10:19:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/cdpa?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R">Current Directions in Psychological Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Current Directions in Psychological Science, Ahead of Print.

While more studies have identified cluster-based MDD subtypes, they often overlook individual variability within subtypes. To address this, we applied latent dirichlet allocation to decompose resting-state functional connectivity (FC) into latent factors. It allows patients to express varying degrees of FC across multiple factors, retaining inter-individual variability. We enrolled 226 patients and 100 healthy controls to identify latent factors and examine their distinct patterns of hyper- and hypo-connectivity. We investigated the association between these connectivity patterns and treatment preferences. Additionally, we compared demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and longitudinal symptom improvements across the identified factors. We identified three factors. Factor 1, characterized by inter-network hyperconnectivity of the default mode network (DMN), was associated with treatment response to antidepressant monotherapy. Additionally, factor 1 was more frequently expressed by younger and highly educated patients, with significant improvements in cognitive symptoms. Conversely, factor 3, characterized by inter-networks and intra-networks hypoconnectivity of DMN, was associated with treatment response when combining antidepressants with stimulation therapy. Factor 2, characterized by global hypoconnectivity without DMN, was associated with higher baseline depression severity and anxiety symptoms. These three factors showed distinct treatment preferences and clinical characteristics. Importantly, our results suggested that patients with DMN hyperconnectivity benefited from monotherapy, while those with DMN hypoconnectivity benefited from combined treatments. Our approach allows for a unique composition of factors in each individual, potentially facilitating the development of more personalized treatment-related biomarkers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pattern of Deep Grey Matter Undersizing Boosts MRI‐Based Diagnostic Classifiers in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70233?af=R</link><author>Eliot Kerdreux,  Justine Fraize,  Alexandra Ntorkou,  Pauline Garzón,  Richard Delorme,  Monique Elmaleh‐Berges,  Edouard Duchesnay,  Lucie Hertz‐Pannier,  Yann Leprince,  Jean‐François Mangin,  David Germanaud</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 12:35:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Using MRI-based normative scaling analysis, we identified a robust pattern of deep grey matter undersizing in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). This novel neuroanatomical marker boosted the performances of brain size-based classifiers and their generalizability to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders lacking FAS-specific clinical features, supporting its use to improve diagnostic reliability.In fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), brain growth deficiency is a hallmark of subjects with both fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and nonsyndromic FASD (NS-FASD, that is, those without specific diagnostic features). Although previous studies have suggested that the deep grey matter is heterogeneously affected at the group level, it has not yet been established within proper scaling modeling, nor has it been given a place in the FASD diagnostic criteria where neuroanatomical features still contribute almost nothing to diagnostic specificity. We segmented a 1.5T T1-weighted brain MRI dataset of 90 monocentric FASD patients (53 FAS, 37 NS-FASD) and 95 typically developing controls (ages 6–20), using volBrain-vol2Brain as reference, and both Freesurfer-SAMSEG and FSL-FIRST to estimate result robustness. The segmentation resulted in seven anatomical volumes: total brain (TBV), total deep grey matter, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and accumbens. After adjusting for confounds, we fitted the scaling relationship between deep grey matter nuclei volumes (V) and TBV (V =  × TBV) and evaluated the effect of FAS on scaling. We then estimated the volumetric deviation from typical scaling (DTS) for each deep grey nucleus volume in the FAS sample. Finally, we tested the improvement of FAS versus control classifiers based on total deep grey matter DTS or total brain deviation from typical volume, by adding the five nuclear DTS, both in terms of performance and generalizability to NS-FASD. Scaling was significantly different between the FAS and control groups for all deep grey matter nuclei ( < 0.05). We confirmed the undersizing of total deep grey matter in FAS (DTS = −6%) and identified a pattern of volumetric undersizing, most pronounced in the caudate (−13%) and globus pallidus (−11%), less so in the thalamus (−4%) and putamen (−2%) and sparing the accumbens (0%). These findings were consistent across segmentation tools, despite variations in magnitude. The pattern-based classifier was more efficient than the one based on total deep grey matter alone ( < 0.001) and identified 32.4% of the NS-FASD as having a FAS-like deep grey matter phenotype, compared to 18.9% with the classifier based on total deep grey matter alone ( = 0.113). Added to a classifier based on TBV only, the pattern improved the performance ( = 0.033) of the model and increased identification of NS-FASD with a FAS-like neuroanatomical phenotype from 37.8% to 62.2% ( = 0.002). This study details the volumetric undersizing of deep grey matter in a large series of FASD patients. It reveals a differential pattern of vulnerability to prenatal alcohol exposure partially convergent across automatic segmentation tools. It also strongly suggests that this pattern of volumetric undersizing in the deep grey matter may contribute to a neuroanatomical signature of FAS that is usable to improve the probabilistic diagnosis of NS-FASD by means of MRI-based diagnostic classifiers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI assistance improves people’s ability to distinguish correct from incorrect eyewitness lineup identifications</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2503971122?af=R</link><author>Lauren E.

We assessed the effectiveness of our method and recent approaches at capturing age-dependent anatomical differences, demonstrating that further refinement is required to accurately capture conditional morphological variability.Deformable brain templates are an important tool in many neuroimaging analyses. Conditional templates (e.g., age-specific templates) have advantages over single population templates by enabling improved registration accuracy and capturing common processes in brain development and degeneration. Conventional methods require large, evenly spread cohorts to develop conditional templates, limiting their ability to create templates that could reflect richer combinations of clinical and demographic variables. More recent deep-learning methods, which can infer relationships in very high-dimensional spaces, open up the possibility of producing conditional templates that are jointly optimised for these richer sets of conditioning parameters. We have built on recent deep-learning template generation approaches using a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) framework to create a purely geometric method of conditional template construction that learns diffeomorphisms between: (i) a global or group template and conditional templates, and (ii) conditional templates and individual brain scans. We evaluated our method, as well as other recent deep-learning approaches, on a data set of cognitively normal (CN) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), using age as the conditioning parameter of interest. We assessed the effectiveness of these networks at capturing age-dependent anatomical differences. Our results demonstrate that while the assessed deep-learning methods have a number of strengths, they require further refinement to capture morphological changes in ageing brains with an acceptable degree of accuracy. The volumetric output of our method, and other recent deep-learning approaches, across four brain structures (grey matter, white matter, the lateral ventricles and the hippocampus), was measured and showed that although each of the methods captured some changes well, each method was unable to accurately track changes in all of the volumes. However, as our method is purely geometric, it was able to produce T1-weighted conditional templates with high spatial fidelity and with consistent topology as age varies, making these conditional templates advantageous for spatial registrations. The use of diffeomorphisms in these deep-learning methods represents an important strength of these approaches, as they can produce conditional templates that can be explicitly linked, geometrically, across age as well as to fixed, unconditional templates or brain atlases. The use of deep learning in conditional template generation provides a framework for creating templates for more complex sets of conditioning parameters, such as pathologies and demographic variables, in order to facilitate a broader application of conditional brain templates in neuroimaging studies. This can aid researchers and clinicians in their understanding of how brain structure changes over time and under various interventions, with the ultimate goal of improving the calibration of treatments and interventions in personalised medicine. The code to implement our conditional brain template network is available at: github.com/lwhitbread/deep-diff.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Human Cortico‐Cerebellar Dynamics During Motor Error Processing After Stroke</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70227?af=R</link><author>Nitesh Singh Malan,  Raghavan Gopalakrishnan,  David Cunningham,  Olivia Hogue,  Kenneth B.

Results highlight centro-parietal error positivity, fronto-centro-parietal desynchronization, and alpha/low-beta cortico-cerebellar coherence, underscoring bidirectional neural interactions in motor error processing.The cerebellum acts as a forward internal model to predict motor outcomes, compare them with sensory feedback, and generate prediction errors that refine prediction accuracy. Our physiological understanding of cerebellar function during motor control derives predominantly from animal experiments and clinical observations in patients with disorders of the cerebellum or its connections with the cerebrum and spinal cord. Here, we report a human electrophysiology-based investigation of cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway activity during motor error detection and correction. Participants performed a computerized motor oddball task while synchronized electrophysiological recordings were collected from cerebellar dentate (DN) using depth electrodes and scalp electroencephalography (EEG). The task involved moving a 2-D ball on a screen toward a predetermined target at 40% (standard trials) or 20% (oddball trials) of their maximum voluntary contraction. Six participants completed an average of 239 trials, with oddball trials randomly occurring with a 30% frequency. At the cortex, oddball trials exhibited significantly greater centro-parietal error positivity and fronto-centro-parietal desynchronization during error correction, predominantly in the alpha and low beta frequency bands. DN examination also revealed greater alpha and low beta desynchronization during error correction. Lastly, oddball trials showed significantly greater cortico-cerebellar coherence during error correction in the same frequency bands with bidirectional interaction between the cortex and DN. These findings expand on the cortico-cerebello-cortical physiology of human motor control and provide cues for designing interventions aimed at alleviating the functional burdens of acquired injuries of the central nervous system.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Issue Information</title><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.26735?af=R</link><author>wileyonlinelibrary@wiley.com (Wiley Online Library)</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 09:41:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970193?af=R">Human Brain Mapping</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Human Brain Mapping, Volume 46, Issue 8, June 1, 2025. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Corrigendum to “Interdependent Minds: Quantifying the Dynamics of Successful Social Interactions”</title><link>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09637214251343551?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R</link><author></author><category>journal</category><category>psychology</category><category>review</category><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 08:28:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/cdpa?ai=2b4&amp;mi=ehikzz&amp;af=R">Current Directions in Psychological Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Current Directions in Psychological Science, Ahead of Print. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Synchrony and subjective experience: the neural correlates of the stream of consciousness</title><link>https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00086-5?rss=yes</link><author>Matthew D.

This opinion article lays out an approach to examining the neural correlates of subjectivity as it unfolds over time. Subjective experience is inherently idiosyncratic, arising from effortless interpretations that feel like perceived facts (p-interpretations), and integrative, with past and expected future moments influencing the current experience. Differential synchrony effects (i.e., neural synchrony that differs between groups) suggest that parts of gestalt cortex (inferior parietal lobule and posterior temporal cortex) and posterior medial cortex track p-interpretations. Differential synchrony may result from each person’s preexisting idiosyncratic non-sensory representations (e.g., expectations, memories, motivations) being integrated with sensory inputs to yield unique meaning-infused immediate experiences across the stream of consciousness.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Electrophysiological Correlates of Lucid Dreaming: Sensor and Source Level Signatures</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e2237242025?rss=1</link><author>Demirel, C., Gott, J., Appel, K., Lu&amp;#x0308;th, K., Fischer, C., Raffaelli, C., Westner, B., Wang, X., Zavecz, Z., Steiger, A., Erlacher, D., LaBerge, S., Mota-Rolim, S., Ribeiro, S., Zeising, M., Adelho&amp;#x0308;fer, N., Dresler, M.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lucid dreaming (LD) is a state of conscious awareness of the ongoing oneiric state, predominantly linked to REM sleep. Progress in understanding its neurobiological basis has been hindered by small sample sizes, diverse EEG setups, and artifacts like saccadic eye movements. To address these challenges in characterizing the electrophysiological correlates of LD, we introduced an adaptive multistage preprocessing pipeline, applied to human data (male and female) pooled across laboratories, allowing us to explore sensor- and source-level markers of LD. We observed that, while sensor-level differences between LD and nonlucid REM sleep were minimal, mixed-frequency analysis revealed broad low alpha to gamma power reductions during LD compared with wakefulness. Source-level analyses showed significant beta power (12–30 Hz) reductions in right central and parietal areas, including the temporoparietal junction, during LD. Moreover, functional connectivity in the alpha band (8–12 Hz) increased during LD compared with nonlucid REM sleep. During initial LD eye signaling compared with the baseline, source-level gamma1 power (30–36 Hz) increased in right temporo-occipital regions, including the right precuneus. Finally, functional connectivity analysis revealed increased interhemispheric and inter-regional gamma1 connectivity during LD, reflecting widespread network engagement. These results suggest that distinct source-level power and connectivity patterns characterize the dynamic neural processes underlying LD, including shifts in network communication and regional activation that may underlie the specific changes in perception, memory processing, self-awareness, and cognitive control. Taken together, these findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of LD, laying the groundwork for decoding the mechanisms of this intriguing state of consciousness.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dissociable Causal Roles of Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex and Primary Motor Cortex over the Course of Motor Skill Development</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e2015232025?rss=1</link><author>Nguyen, Q.

As skill develops, automatic and "effortless" performance coincides with a transition to a reliance on sensorimotor circuits that include primary motor cortex (M1). However, the dynamics of how control evolves during the transition from novice to expert are currently unclear. This lack of clarity is due, in part, to the fact that most motor learning studies comprise a limited number of training sessions and rely on correlative techniques such as neuroimaging. Here, we train human participants (both sexes) on a discrete motor sequencing task over the course of 6 weeks, followed by an assessment of the causal roles of DLPFC and M1 at varying levels of expertise. We use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to transiently disrupt activity in these regions immediately prior to performance in separate sessions. Our results confirm the dissociable importance of DLPFC and M1 as training progresses. DLPFC stimulation leads to larger behavioral deficits for novice skills than more highly trained skills, while M1 stimulation leads to relatively larger deficits as training progresses. However, our results also reveal that prefrontal disruption causes performance deficits at all levels of training. These findings challenge existing models and indicate an evolving rather than a strictly diminishing role for DLPFC throughout learning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Inattentional Rhythm in Audition</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e1544242025?rss=1</link><author>Lui, T.

In audition, however, such an effect seemed to be absent. Due to the transient nature of its input, the auditory system might be particularly vulnerable to information loss that occurs if relevant information coincides with the low-excitability phase of the oscillation. We therefore hypothesized that effects of oscillatory phase in audition will be restored if auditory events are made task irrelevant and information loss can be tolerated. To this end, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 29 human participants (21F) while they detected pure tones at one sound frequency and ignored others. Confirming our hypothesis, we found that the neural response to task-irrelevant but not to task-relevant tones depends on the prestimulus phase of neural oscillations. Alpha oscillations modulated early stages of stimulus processing, whereas theta oscillations (~3–7 Hz) affected later components, possibly related to distractor inhibition. We also found evidence that alpha oscillations alternate between sound frequencies during divided attention. Together, our results suggest that the efficacy of auditory oscillations depends on the context they operate in and demonstrate how they can be employed in a system that heavily relies on information unfolding over time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Repeated tDCS at Clinically Relevant Field Intensity Can Boost Concurrent Motor Learning in Rats</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e1495242025?rss=1</link><author>Farahani, F., Vo&amp;#x0308;ro&amp;#x0308;slakos, M., Birnbaum, A.

We hypothesized that weak stimulation will produce sizable effects, provided it is applied concurrently with behavioral training and repeated over multiple sessions. We tested this in a rodent model of dexterous motor skill learning using a pellet-reaching task in  behaving rats. The task was automated to minimize experimenter bias. We measured field magnitudes intracranially to calibrate the stimulation current. Male rats were trained for 20 min with concurrent epicranial tDCS over 10 daily sessions. We developed a new electrode montage that enabled stable stimulation over the 10 sessions with a field intensity of 2 V/m at the motor cortex. Behavior was recorded with high-speed video to quantify reaching dynamics. We also measured motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) bilaterally with epidural microstimulation. The number of successful reaches improved across days of training, and the rate of learning was higher in the anodal group as compared with sham-control animals ( = 7.12;  = 0.008;  = 24). MEPs were not systematically affected by tDCS. Post hoc analysis suggests that tDCS modulated motor learning only for right-pawed animals, improving success of reaching but limiting stereotypy in these animals. Repeated and concurrent anodal tDCS can boost motor skill learning at clinically relevant field intensities. In this animal model, the effect interacted with paw preference and was not associated with corticospinal excitability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Similar Computational Hierarchies for Reading and Speech in the Occipital Cortex of Sighed and Blind: Converging Evidence from fMRI and Chronometric TMS</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e1153242024?rss=1</link><author>Matuszewski, J., Bola, &amp;#x0141;ukasz, Collignon, O., Marchewka, A.</author><category>journal</category><category>cognitive-neuroscience</category><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://www.jneurosci.org/">Journal of Neuroscience</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[High-level perception results from interactions between hierarchical brain systems responsive to gradually increasing feature complexities. During reading, the initial evaluation of simple visual features in the early visual cortex (EVC) is followed by orthographic and lexical computations in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC). While similar visual regions are engaged in tactile Braille reading in congenitally blind people, it is unclear whether the visual network maintains or reorganizes its hierarchy for reading in this population. Combining fMRI and chronometric transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), our study revealed a clear correspondence between sighted and blind individuals (both male and female) on how their occipital cortices functionally supports reading and speech processing. Using fMRI, we first observed that vOTC, but not EVC, showed an enhanced response to lexical vs nonlexical information in both groups and sensory modalities. Using TMS, we further found that, in both groups, the processing of written words and pseudowords was disrupted by the EVC stimulation at both early and late time windows. In contrast, the vOTC stimulation disrupted the processing of these written stimuli only when applied at late time windows, again in both groups. In the speech domain, we observed TMS effects only for meaningful words and only in the blind participants. Overall, our results suggest that, while the responses in the deprived visual areas might extend their functional response to other sensory modalities, the computational gradients between early and higher-order occipital regions are retained, at least for reading.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;What&quot; and &quot;When&quot; Predictions Jointly Modulate Speech Processing</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e1049242025?rss=1</link><author>Auksztulewicz, R., O&amp;#x0308;du&amp;#x0308;l, O.

Such regularities pertain to stimulus contents ("what") and timing ("when"), and both interactively modulate sensory processing. In speech streams, predictions can be formed at multiple hierarchical levels of contents (e.g., syllables vs words) and timing (faster vs slower time scales). Whether and how these hierarchies map onto each other remains unknown. Under one hypothesis, neural hierarchies may link "what" and "when" predictions within sensory processing areas: with lower versus higher cortical regions mediating interactions for smaller versus larger units (syllables vs words). Alternatively, interactions between "what" and "when" regularities might rest on a generic, sensory-independent mechanism. To address these questions, we manipulated "what" and "when" regularities at two levels—single syllables and disyllabic pseudowords—while recording neural activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy volunteers ( = 22). We studied how neural responses to syllable and/or pseudoword deviants are modulated by "when" regularity. "When" regularity modulated "what" mismatch responses with hierarchical specificity, such that responses to deviant pseudowords (vs syllables) were amplified by temporal regularity at slower (vs faster) time scales. However, both these interactive effects were source-localized to the same regions, including frontal and parietal cortices. Effective connectivity analysis showed that the integration of "what" and "when" regularity selectively modulated connectivity within regions, consistent with gain effects. This suggests that the brain integrates "what" and "when" predictions that are congruent with respect to their hierarchical level, but this integration is mediated by a shared and distributed cortical network.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Orbitofrontal High-Gamma Reflects Spike-Dissociable Value and Decision Mechanisms</title><link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/20/e0789242025?rss=1</link><author>Sharma, D., Lupkin, S.

While much is known about how OFC neurons represent values, far less is known about information encoded in OFC local field potentials (LFPs). LFPs are important because they can reflect subthreshold activity not directly coupled to spiking and because they are potential targets for less invasive forms of brain–machine interface (BMI). We recorded neural activity in the OFC of male macaques performing a two-option value-based decision task. We compared the value- and decision-coding properties of high-gamma LFPs (HG, 50–150 Hz) to the coding properties of spiking multiunit activity (MUA) recorded concurrently on the same electrodes. HG and MUA both represented the values of decision targets, but HG signals had value-coding features that were distinct from concurrently measured MUA. On average HG amplitude increased monotonically with value, whereas in MUA the value encoding was net neutral on average. HG encoded a signal consistent with a comparison between target values, a signal which was negligible in MUA. In individual channels, HG could predict choice outcomes more accurately than MUA; however, when channels were combined in a population-based decoder, MUA was more accurate than HG. In summary, HG signals reveal value-coding features in OFC that could not be observed from spiking activity, including representation of value comparisons and more accurate behavioral predictions. These results have implications for the role of OFC in value-based decisions and suggest that high-frequency LFPs may be a viable—or even preferable—target for BMIs to assist cognitive function.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kernels of selfhood: GPT-4o shows humanlike patterns of cognitive dissonance moderated by free choice</title><link>https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2501823122?af=R</link><author>Steven A.
