This followed a major Russian air assault on Kharkiv city the same day, as Russia reportedly targeted the city with 67 explosive drones, nine aerial bombs, and a missile.Ukraine seeks to acquire American-made Patriot systems, which are among the few Western air defense platforms capable of intercepting ballistic missiles. These missiles are regularly used by Russia to target Ukrainian cities. Moscow conducts daily attacks on residential neighborhoods far from the frontline, using long-range explosive drones and sometimes adding missiles to the assaults. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump pushes for Kyiv-Moscow talks, allegedly to end the ongoing war, in order to restore relations with Russia.Zelenskyy calls for urgent US supportIn his evening address on 7 June, Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine urgently needs “” from the US — not just words, but concrete decisions. “We are working to strengthen Ukraine’s air defense. We urgently need positive signals from the United States – concrete signals regarding air defense systems,” he said. “We are still waiting for a response to our request to purchase systems that can help — concrete signals, not words.”He also thanked European nations for their support and emphasized the importance of joint production efforts.“We must also achieve results in the joint production of air defense systems and missiles for them – this is absolutely essential for our whole Europe,” Zelenskyy noted, adding that “only time separates us from that result, and what matters most is shortening that time.”Reuters: US expects another multi-pronged Russian strike after Ukraine’s Spiderweb drone attackThe statement came after a Ukrainian delegation visited Washington on 6 June. According to the head of the Office of the President, Andrii Yermak, Ukraine expressed its readiness to buy weapons from the US. However, Yermak stated that members of Congress believe Washington can continue supplying arms directly to Ukraine instead.On 6 June, Russia attacked Kyiv, Lutsk, and Ternopil with hundreds of drones and 45 missiles, leading to heavy casualties among civilians. That day, US President Donald Trump appeared to defend Russia’s massive airstrike on Ukrainian cities the night before, claiming that Ukraine’s Operation Spiderweb had given Vladimir Putin “a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night.” Earlier, after a phone call with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, he said Russia’s reaction would “” You could close this page.

Now, however, the economy is facing a risky combination of factors—including rising prices, slowing growth and an acute labor shortage—that is threatening its stability and outlook.In a sign that the Kremlin is aware of how fragile the country's economic position currently is, Russia's central bank cut its key interest rate to 20 percent on Friday, down from a two-decade high of 21 percent.According to the report released earlier this week and authored by Belousov, GDP growth in Russia slowed down to 1.4 percent in Q1 2025 compared to a year earlier. While inflation is slowing down, it remains very high, at 9.8 percent.While slowing investments in machinery and equipment has played into this slowdown, Belousov said that it has been accelerated by "growing problems in construction," with the number of new projects now declining, and falling consumer demand, especially when it comes to non-food products. According to the report, consumer spending has been stagnating since mid-2024.The combination of rising inflation and stagnant economic growth could bring the Russian economy into a state of "stagflation," which is usually also characterized by high unemployment. In Russia, according to official data, unemployment is currently low at 2.4 percent.Belousov presented a "countdown" to a potential crisis in Russia. The report said that a potential downturn of the Russian economy could unfold between Q2 and Q3 2025 as a slowdown in economic growth and falling consumer demand and as a weakening of the ruble between Q3 and Q4 2025.This loss in value for the Russian currency would be caused by a dip in trade in the first half of the year and a growth in imports, Belousov said, taking into consideration the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs."It is easy to see that the 'trigger' of a new intensification of the crisis could be another step in tightening the interest rate policy of the Bank of Russia, provoked by the (almost inevitable) weakening of the ruble, an increase in administratively regulated tariffs and a corresponding jump in inflation," Belousov wrote.The analyst recommends that the country focuses on reducing inflation to avoid the worst possible scenario for the Russian economy, as well as on supporting "the entry of Russian products into all available external markets" and stimulating investments in fixed capital.The Central Bank of the Russian Federation said in a statement explaining its decision on Friday: "Domestic demand continues to outstrip the economy's capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, but Russia is gradually returning to a more balanced growth path."Russia's central bank's Governor Elvira Nabiullina said in a press conference on Friday: "We are close to a scenario of balanced economic growth." According to Nabiullina, "monetary policy will remain tight for a long period."She added: "Inflation ultimately eats away at the economy's potential, so our goal is to curb inflation and allow the real sector of the economy to develop."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Will Private Equity Change Big Law?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzAmjJ--QkU</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WzAmjJ--QkU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 14:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Big law is going through a transformation as private equity sees the investment potential in law firms.

The report comes amid a high-profile public conflict between Elon Musk, the world’s wealthiest businessman, and his former ally, U.S. President Donald Trump. In May, Musk announced he would step down as an advisor to Trump and as the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Since then, he has emerged as a major critic of the president.The pro-Kremlin event will be hosted by the Tsargrad Institute and led by far-right Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin. "I am eager to meet everyone. As far as I know, Russians are among the most intelligent people on the planet. It would be foolish not to ask their opinion on all sorts of issues," Errol Musk was quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency TASS.Among the forum's panels are sessions titled "Russian Space: The Race for Mars" and "The Battle for Hearts and Minds: The Ideology of Sovereign Russia." According to Kommersant, scheduled speakers include Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, and prominent state TV anchor Ekaterina Andreeva.Errol Musk, a former South African businessman and politician, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him "a strong leader" and saying that "it would be foolish not to admire Putin" in an April interview with BBC Russia.  Errol's attendance at the far-right event comes amid growing scrutiny of his son, Elon Musk, whose role as the head of SpaceX and the Starlink satellite network places him at the center of both U.S. defense operations and Ukraine's battlefield communications.SpaceX holds billions in Pentagon and NASA contracts, including a $1.8-billion agreement with the U.S. intelligence community to build a classified spy satellite system.Despite initially aiding Ukraine by providing Starlink terminals to stabilize battlefield communications, Elon Musk has increasingly echoed Kremlin-aligned narratives. He has suggested that President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks public support in Ukraine and has repeatedly called U.S. aid a driver of a "never-ending draft meat grinder."Those statements have been warmly received by Russian officials, military bloggers, and state media outlets, which have praised Musk as a voice of reason and a critic of Western involvement in the war.Dmitry Novikov, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's international affairs committee, said on June 6 that Moscow is ready to grant political asylum to Musk following his public dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Leo criticises ‘exclusionary mindset’ of nationalist political movements</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/08/pope-leo-criticises-exclusionary-mindset-of-nationalist-political-movements</link><author>/u/BreakfastTop6899</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 13:08:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Leo has criticised the emergence of nationalist political movements and their “exclusionary mindset”, without naming a specific country or leader.Leo, the first pope from the US, asked during a mass on Sunday with tens of thousands in St Peter’s Square that God “open borders, break down walls [and] dispel hatred”.“There is no room for prejudice, for ‘security’ zones separating us from our neighbours, for the exclusionary mindset that, unfortunately, we now see emerging also in political nationalisms,” he said.The pontiff said the church “must open the borders between peoples and break down the barriers between class and race”.“People must move “beyond our fear of those who are different,” he said, saying the Holy Spirit “breaks down barriers and tears down the walls of indifference and hatred”.Leo, formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected on 8 May to succeed the late Pope Francis as leader of the 1.4 billion-member church.Before becoming pontiff, Prevost was not shy about criticising Donald Trump, sharing numerous disapproving posts about the US president and the vice-president, JD Vance, on X in recent years.The Vatican has not confirmed the pope’s ownership of the X account, which had the handle @drprevost, and was deactivated after his election.Francis, who was pope for 12 years, was a sharp critic of Trump.

We should get decisions now," Orpo said. A NATO summit is slated to take place June 24-26 in the Netherlands. The important meeting is expected to cover a wide range of issues, including defense spending and Russia's war against Ukraine.At a June 5 joint press conference alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump said lawmakers were waiting for his approval before advancing the Russian sanctions bill."They'll be guided by me. That's how it's supposed to be," Trump said. "They're waiting for me to decide on what to do."Senate Democrat Richard Blumenthal, who also leads the sanctions bill, has confirmed that negotiations have been taking place behind the scenes with White House officials.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Leo criticises ‘exclusionary mindset’ of nationalist political movements</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/08/pope-leo-criticises-exclusionary-mindset-of-nationalist-political-movements</link><author>/u/BreakfastTop6899</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 12:38:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Leo has criticised the emergence of nationalist political movements and their “exclusionary mindset”, without naming a specific country or leader.Leo, the first pope from the US, asked during a mass on Sunday with tens of thousands in St Peter’s Square that God “open borders, break down walls [and] dispel hatred”.“There is no room for prejudice, for ‘security’ zones separating us from our neighbours, for the exclusionary mindset that, unfortunately, we now see emerging also in political nationalisms,” he said.The pontiff said the church “must open the borders between peoples and break down the barriers between class and race”.“People must move “beyond our fear of those who are different,” he said, saying the Holy Spirit “breaks down barriers and tears down the walls of indifference and hatred”.Leo, formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected on 8 May to succeed the late Pope Francis as leader of the 1.4 billion-member church.Before becoming pontiff, Prevost was not shy about criticising Donald Trump, sharing numerous disapproving posts about the US president and the vice-president, JD Vance, on X in recent years.The Vatican has not confirmed the pope’s ownership of the X account, which had the handle @drprevost, and was deactivated after his election.Francis, who was pope for 12 years, was a sharp critic of Trump.

But it was still seen as a win for Merz."Being sidelined is not necessarily always a bad thing," Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, told CNBC on Friday. "In fact, it might have even helped Merz as the Musk distraction was also deviating attention away from more controversial topics."It was a high-stakes trip for Merz, who is just a few weeks into his chancellorship, especially given the treatment other leaders have gotten from Trump in the Oval Office in recent months.As such, Merz is unlikely to be disappointed about the outcome — especially given the potential downsides."Having avoided an escalation in the Oval Office is already an achievement these days," Brzeski added.Merz arrived in Washington with a full agenda that ranged from strengthening relations between the U.S. and Germany, to tariffs — which could significantly impact key German industries — as well as U.S. support for Ukraine in its war with Russia and higher NATO defense spending.While we don't know what was discussed behind closed doors, Merz was seemingly able to address most of these points with Trump, political strategist Julius van de Laar told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday."I think what Friedrich Merz got across is that he hopes that the U.S. president will continue to support Ukraine," he said, noting that the issue had gathered momentum recently given several significant attacks. Merz was able to pick up on this, and draw links to the anniversary of D-Day a day after their meeting."And he said the United States played a great role in ... freeing Europe from the Nazi regime back then, and so he's hoping that Donald Trump will ... say we're going to get engaged again and help Europe become free of dictatorship," van de Laar said.Merz making this point was important in the context of highlighting the U.S.-German relationship, according to Jackson Janes, senior resident fellow at the German Marshall Fund. Speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe," he also pointed out that Trump was gifted his grandfather's birth certificate by Merz, "making the point 'you have a relationship with Germany in your own family.'"German Chancellor Friedrich Merz presents US President Donald Trump with what Merz said was the birth certificate of Trump's grandfather, who was born in 1869, during a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on June 5, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesJanes also noted that Merz highlighting Germany's plans for higher defense spending would have marked a positive note in the discussion.Germany recently changed its fiscal rules to allow for higher defense spending, and Merz's government seems to be making it a priority. The chancellor has promised a financial push to boost the German military, and the country's foreign minister has suggested support for Trump's proposal that NATO members spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense.Meanwhile, the sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party, the Alternative fuer Deutschland, was seemingly avoided. Officials in the Trump administration have in recent weeks come out in support of the party after German intelligence services classified it as a "proven right-wing extremist organization."This led to clapbacks from German politicians, with Merz himself warning the U.S. not to get involved. The classification of the AfD is currently on hold amid a legal challenge.All in all, Merz's visit to D.C. was seen as "a home run or a hole in one," van de Laar said.ING's Brzeski also suggested that the trip laid good foundations between the leaders. "There seems to be some common grounds between Trump and Merz, which could be the seeds for a more constructive relationship," he said.Merz even appeared to get some compliments from Trump, with the president commending him for his English skills and saying that while "difficult," the German leader was a "very good man to deal with."Following the meeting, Merz appeared satisfied, saying in a social media post that the atmosphere was "really good," and that the two have much in common. "I am coming back with the feeling that we can speak on the phone any time," he said, according to a CNBC translation.But even an in-person reunion might not be too far off: a Trump trip to Berlin is already being planned, Merz told German media.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why are Gen Z’s bar tab payment habits anybody’s business?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQs4jhXsB5c</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LQs4jhXsB5c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 09:00:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bars are complaining that young customers aren’t leaving tabs open like they used to, according to a recent New York Times story.

He has previously voiced opposition to Ukraine's membership in the EU and NATO, despite supporting Ukraine's sovereignty."Poland has such an interest, for example, in the exhumation of the Volyn (massacre) victims," Nawrocki said.Polish and Ukrainian researchers began exhuming victims of the World War II era massacres on April 24 in Western Ukraine.It was the first such exhumation since 2017, when Ukraine imposed a moratorium in response to the destruction of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) memorials in Poland."During the campaign, I did not agree, and as president, I will not agree, to unfair competition with Ukraine for Polish agriculture or the logistics sector," Nawrocki said.EU tariffs on Ukrainian agricultural exports resumed on June 6, amid opposition to Ukrainian exports and its EU accession from eastern European members, including Hungary and Poland."I see Ukraine as a country that, although it is very bravely defending itself against the Russian Federation, must also respect the interests of other countries that otherwise support Ukraine," he said.In contrast to other Eurosceptic leaders in Europe, including Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Nawrocki does not express pro-Russian views, but has repeatedly accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of taking advantage of allies.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada won’t become the 51st US state – but could it join the EU?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/08/canada-wont-become-the-51st-us-state-but-could-it-join-the-eu?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other</link><author>/u/sseumblue</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 07:15:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[oachim Streit has never stepped foot in Canada. But that hasn’t stopped the German politician from launching a tenacious, one-man campaign that he readily describes as “aspirational”: to have the North American country join the EU.“We have to strengthen the European Union,” said Streit, who last year was elected as a member of the European parliament. “And I think Canada – as its prime minister says – is the most European country outside of Europe.”Streit had long imagined Canada as a sort of paradise, home to dense forests that course with wide, rushing rivers. But after Donald Trump returned to power, launching much of the world into a trade war and turning his back on America’s traditional allies, Streit began to cast the northern country in a new light.What he saw was a relatively unexplored relationship, one that could prove mutually beneficial as the world grapples with rapidly reshaping global dynamics. “Canadians have seen their trust in the US undermined, just as we have in Europe, following President Trump’s actions,” he said. “We need to strengthen the ties that bind us to our friends.”While he admitted that the possibility of Canada as a full member of the EU “may be aspirational for now”, he wondered if it was an idea whose time had come.“Canada would be a strong member,” he said. “If Canada would be a member of the EU, it would rank 4th in terms of GDP. It’s part of Nato. And 58% of (working-age) Canadians have college degrees.”Canada also has vast energy reserves – an asset that could prove useful to the bloc, which is still struggling to wean itself off Russian gas, he added.Since launching his campaign last month, Streit has become the most visible proponent of an unlikely proposition that has been gaining traction since Trump began floating the idea of Canada as the 51st state.In late January, a former foreign minister of Germany, Sigmar Gabriel, called for Canada to be invited into the EU. “They are more European than some European member states anyway,” he told Germany’s Pioneer Media.In March, however, a European spokesperson appeared to pour cold water on the suggestion, citing an article in the EU treaty that specifies only European states can apply to join the EU.Streit brushed off the technicality, pointing to France’s overseas territories. “Those are also not in Europe, but those islands belong to the European Union,” he said. Cyprus, considered EU territory but located geographically in west Asia, was another example.And if one wanted to get technical, Canada was – albeit in a minuscule way – connected geographically to Europe, he said. “Greenland, which belongs to Denmark, shares a border with Canada,” he said, pointing to the divide that runs through the uninhabited half-mile square Hans Island.In April, Streit submitted a written question to the European parliament, asking whether the treaty article stipulating that states must be European could be interpreted in a way that could allow for Canadian membership or, barring that, if it could be legally revised. He has yet to receive a response.Undaunted, he sent a letter to two EU commissioners calling for a sort of political Erasmus to be launched between the bloc and Canada. What he envisions is a professional exchange programme that would allow EU officials to better grasp the nuances of Canadian federalism and Canadians to get a sense of the workings of European institutions.“It would serve as both a symbolic and practical step toward deeper integration,” he said, one that could build on existing ties such as the EU-Canada trade deal and Canada’s participation in the EU’s flagship science research programme, Horizon.Since launching the campaign, he’s been in constant contact with Canadians; meeting twice with one of Canada’s high-ranking envoys to the EU and meeting with a Brussels-based association that promotes Canada-EU trade.As news spreads of his efforts, his office has received a handful of emails of support. Some have offered up their own thoughts on how to skirt around Canada’s geographic location; one recent email laid out what the writer described as a “killer argument”, pointing out that as part of the Commonwealth Canada was tied to the UK and, by extension, Europe.Streit took it one step further. “And who is the head of Canada?” he asked, pointing to King Charles. “And he’s a European.”Streit said he was well aware that, for all his efforts, the idea may prove to be impossible. Even so, he hoped that the moment could be seized on to at least hammer out the kind of deep ties the bloc has with countries such as Norway or Switzerland.“Sometimes in history, the windows of opportunity open and close again,” he said. “And sometimes, the windows of opportunity are open only for a brief moment.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>France opens ‘complicity in genocide’ probes against French-Israelis over blocked Gaza aid</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/france-opens-complicity-in-genocide-probes-over-blocked-gaza-aid/</link><author>/u/soalone34</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 05:12:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Could this fungus help tackle the plastic waste crisis?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wANgRTkHVuo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wANgRTkHVuo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 05:01:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A newly isolated marine-derived fungus that can degrade polypropylene, discovered by Australian researchers, could represent a breakthrough in the battle against plastic waste.
