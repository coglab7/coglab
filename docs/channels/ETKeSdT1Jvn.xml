The escape routes they used, established by Nazi sympathisers, came to be known as 'ratlines'. The escaping Nazis had helped from an unexpected source; senior figures within the Catholic Church.The story of SS officer Walter Rauff exemplifies how these networks operated and the subsequent lives of the escapees. Rauff was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people during the Second World War and was a key perpetrator of the Holocaust. After escaping to Chile, he would eventually come to work for the brutal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. There he would go on to inflict further miseries on the Chilean people. Rauff was never put on trial, but is it possible to obtain a different kind of justice for his numerous crimes?Philippe Sands, a renowned British-French lawyer and author, joins Dan to provide insights from his book '38 Londres Street: On Impunity, Pinochet in England and a Nazi in Patagonia', which explores Rauff's life and actions and the involvement of the Catholic Church.Produced & edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>David Bentley Hart - Can Metaphysics Discern God?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnSl3oP_4sA</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WnSl3oP_4sA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 8 Jun 2025 15:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Follow Closer To Truth on Instagram for updates, announcements, and videos: https://shorturl.at/EzYo9

Metaphysics is the deepest probe of reality. It is the branch of philosophy that discerns the most general features of the world. When focused on God, metaphysics seeks insights not readily apparent, such as possible contradictions (or coherence) among various traits of God. Other topics include tensions between God and time, and God and abstract objects.

What are the thought processes, the ways of thinking, of science and religion? How do the ‘scientific method’ and the ‘religious method’ compare and contrast? Moreover, how to develop trust in the separate truths of science and religion?

Crews on the ships of Christopher Columbus, Vasco De Gama and Ferdinand Magellan often sailed blind into uncharted waters, battling hurricanes and deadly reefs. With crude navigation tools, rotting food, and disease-ridden ships, survival was never guaranteed. Crews were pushed to their limits—physically, mentally, and morally. Some were deceived into the journey, and others driven by blind hope.In this episode, Dan is joined by Simon Parker, an associate professor in Medieval and Renaissance Portuguese at the University of Oxford, to tell some of the stories of extraordinary failure and disaster in the age of discovery.His new book is called Wreckers: Disaster in the Age of DiscoveryProduced by James Hickmann and edited by Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Frank Tipler - Will the Universe Ever End?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5HSZagL42A</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/M5HSZagL42A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 3 Jun 2025 19:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For subscriber-only exclusives, register for a free membership today: https://closertotruth.com/register/

What about mass and energy, even space and time? What’s the ‘Big Crunch’ and the ‘Big Rip’? And what if there are multiple universes, will the multiverse ever end?

Ghostly encounters, alien abductions, reincarnation, talking to the dead, UFO sightings, inexplicable coincidences, out-of-body and near-death experiences. Are these legitimate phenomena? If not, how should we go about understanding them? In his latest book, Chris French investigates paranormal claims to discover what lurks behind this “weird shit”. French provides authoritative, evidence-based explanations for a wide range of superficially mysterious phenomena, and then goes further to draw out lessons with wider applications to many other aspects of modern society where critical thinking is urgently needed.

Chris French's book, "The Science of Weird Shit: Why Our Minds Conjure the Paranormal", is available for purchase now: https://amzn.to/43rxMoQ

Chris French is Emeritus Professor and Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit in the Psychology Department at Goldsmiths, University of London. He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society and of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a Patron of Humanists UK.

Philosophy of religion poses numerous questions about God: “proof” or “disproofs” of existence, nature and attributes, personhood, relation to time, relation to humankind — it’s a long list. In Judeo-Christian religions, the ultimate authority is supposed to be the Bible. But the Bible seems radically different from philosophy of religion.

How to imagine the experience of eternal life? Would we sense ourselves? How would we feel? Whom would we know? What would we do? What would God do? Living forever seems so absurd, yet eternal life is the promise of almost every religion. But if we cannot even imagine what eternal life will be, how can we have hope in its reality?

Can God and the enormity of evil both exist? To theists, it’s the problem of evil, which they struggle to resolve. To atheists, it’s the argument from evil, which they wield like a sword. Theists try to absolve God by differentiating ‘God allowing evil’ from ‘God creating evil’. But if God is all-powerful and all-knowing, how could God not have created evil?

The largest naval fleet in human history assembled to support the amphibious invasion of the island.

The gruelling battle that ensued would influence the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Japan and ultimately alter the course of history.Joining us is Seth Paridon, a historian for the US Army and co-host of the podcast ‘The Unauthorised History of the Pacific War’.
