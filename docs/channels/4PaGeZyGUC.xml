They live and work on the island. But everyday life in this supposed paradise is also sometimes overshadowed by existential worries and loneliness.

The Portuguese island of Madeira lies in the Atlantic Ocean. It is known as the island of eternal spring. With its pleasant climate and community, the village of Ponta do Sol attracts young freelancers like Nina and Heiko. But rents and the general cost of living here have risen sharply, pricing out locals.
Nina arrived in Madeira in 2021. Her goal: to set up a "digital village‚Äù for young freelancers in Ponta do Sol. The young woman from Munich is still here, but things have changed since the early days. Most freelancers only stay for a few months and then move on. With such a transient community, it‚Äôs difficult to build close friendships.
The "first village for digital nomads‚Äù advertised on social media mainly consists of a co-working space where freelancers can work for free. The high turnover of travelers inspired Nina to come up with her business idea: she manages shared flats, known as ‚Äòco-livings‚Äô, where freelancers can find a ‚Äòtemporary home‚Äô.
Heiko is packed and ready and dreaming of a life on the island. "Madeira is definitely my dream destination,‚Äù he says. The graphic designer has loved the island since he was a child. Now he wants to gain a foothold there with the help of the digital community.

When you sign on to be a celebrity in Hollywood, you also sign an unspoken contract putting you on public display. 

Magazines like the National Enquirer and shows like TMZ have turned celebrity life into a profitable industry, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the paparazzi is a recent trend. As it turns out, Americans have been obsessing over celebrity drama for over 100 years.

The raw material interests of rich nations often trump the rights and needs of the local populations.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, people are being exploited in mines. Chinese traders are illegally buying cobalt, a material Europe needs for its green energy transition. Therefore, Europe buys the cobalt from these illegal traders. The EU now wants to free itself from its dependence on China for raw materials and expand its own local activities. They promise to act more fairly than China - though some say this is not a reasonable promise.
A huge hydrogen project involving Germany is being planned on the south-east coast of Namibia. The local population is also supposed to benefit from it. However, parts of a national park will be destroyed by the billions being spent in the name of green investment. "Why doesn't Germany sacrifice its own protected parks for green hydrogen?‚Äù asks Namibia's well-known environmental activist Chris Brown. 
In the oil-contaminated mangrove forests of the Niger Delta in Nigeria, it becomes clear that Europe is not as climate-friendly as it likes to claim. After all, since the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, numerous European investors have been attempting to discreetly arrange lucrative natural gas deals in the country. Congolese activist Patricia Kashala also complains that Europe gives the impression of acting in an exemplary manner, but in practice often puts its own interests in raw materials above the rights of the local population.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary O‚ÄôReilly learn about Nobel-prize-winning Alphafold, the protein folding problem, and how solving it could end disease with AI researcher and Chief AI Officer of Isomorphic Labs, Max Jaderberg. 

We break down the protein folding problem and why it was so hard to crack. How do we learn to decode how strings of amino acids fold into complex, dynamic shapes that power our biology? How did AlphaFold crack this decades-old puzzle? We explore how Alphafold 3 uses the shapes of proteins to predict protein-drug interactions. How close are we to using AI and deep learning to design new medicines instead of discovering them by chance? Could generative AI invent molecules that precisely target the cause of a disease?

We take these ideas into the future: Could AI help us fix misfolded proteins that cause illness? Can we use these tools to create personalized drugs tailored to your unique genome? Will it make it economically feasible to treat rare diseases? Could this even help us slow aging or regenerate limbs, like salamanders do? Could this technology combat cancer, fix rare genetic disorders, or even digest plastic? And with quantum computing on the horizon, what happens when we combine it with AI? Will chemistry ever be done the same way again?

ABSTRACT
Inefficiency is ruining our planet and our lives. Efficiency is ruining our happiness, and weirdly, it‚Äôs also ruining our efficiency. Heeeeelppp!? What‚Äôs a techie to do? Zombie servers and slow code are a big climate problem, but the vrrrooom model gives us double-win hope. Holly walks through a range of techniques that can be used to find and eliminate software waste and reduce climate impacts.

But machine efficiency isn‚Äôt much use without human efficiency. Surprisingly, sorting out machine efficiency often helps humans, too. For example, the Quarkus Java framework uses many interesting waste-reduction techniques. These optimisations have the dual benefit of speeding up computers, and also speeding up people.

So far, so good, but we need to be careful we don‚Äôt end up accidentally optimising the wrong things, and making stuff worse. 100% utilisation is not sustainable for either humans, or people. It‚Äôs not even very efficient (what!?). Holly gives a brief tour of the brain‚Äôs default mode network, the latest business research, and queueing theory, to show why we actually achieve more when we do a bit less. [...]

Donald Trump and Elon Musk have been locked in a public fight after Musk spent days bashing Trump's "big, beautiful bill" ‚Äî a multi-trillion dollar budget key to unlocking the president's agenda currently being voted on in the Senate. In return, the president threatened to cut the federal government's contracts with Musk's companies, including SpaceX.

Scientists are only just beginning to understand the vital role fungi plays, poised between the plant and animal worlds. It‚Äôs a mystery that is gradually being solved.

Life on Earth wouldn‚Äôt be possible without fungi. Yet they largely elude our view, as they form a finely tuned network that runs through the soil of the forests. Everywhere on Earth. Whether in the centuries-old rainforests of Tasmania or in China's Yunnan Province - researchers are trying to understand exactly how fungi maintain the balance of ecosystems. 

So much more than mushrooms, fungi shape weather and support life on land. They‚Äôre also at the cutting edge of medical research, and even have the power to break down plastic waste.

Whether under the microscope or in the woods, the dazzling images in this documentary immerse you in the mysterious world of mushrooms.

ABSTRACT
How can you tell how good your software development process is working? Continuous Delivery is state of the art for software development, it is how most of the best software companies in the world work. So how close is your organisation to achieving Continuous Delivery? CD is the best way to organise your work, but it is not an easy process to adopt. So what are the markers of success, what are the targets to aim for, and the measuring sticks that will help you evaluate where you are now, and what next steps you should take.

In this episode, Dave Farley, author of the book that introduced Continuous Delivery as an approach, explores these questions and defines a checklist of 14 markers that if you are achieving them clearly state that you are indeed practicing CD and building better software faster. These are excellent tools to help you on your journey and can help you to decide where to next focus your efforts to improve.

DESCRIPTION
Julian Wood and Tom Johnson explore the complexities of modern software development, with Tom sharing his journey from machine learning and distributed systems to founding Multiplayer, a company focused on simplifying development by automating documentation, debugging, and system design.

They discuss the challenges of building and managing complex software architectures, especially with microservices and cloud platforms, and the need for better tooling to address these issues. Tom emphasizes the importance of simplicity, collaboration, and transparency in development, especially when it comes to API design and managing system dependencies. They also explore best practices for team communication, the evolving role of platform engineering, and the shift toward a future where infrastructure is abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on software creation.

Its popularity since 2017 has driven the company‚Äôs share price to an all-time high.  

Now it's betting big on a follow-up, the Switch 2. It‚Äôs the first major hardware release from the company in eight years. It‚Äôs bigger and more powerful and importantly plays existing Switch games.

But at $450, it lands on the more expensive end of most estimates. And US President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade war could force the Japanese gaming giant to lift the price even higher, which could dissuade buyers.

It is a region full of evidence of the connections early Christians made here with places and events in the Bible, from Moses to the baptism of Jesus.

The journey begins overlooking the Jordan Valley on Mount Nebo, the site of the death of Moses and a place of pilgrimage for centuries.

Near Mount Nebo, at Madaba, Dan discovers one of the most extraordinary maps of the ancient world, created by the Christian community here in the 5th century AD. It is a spectacular layout of the Holy Land and the world as these early Christians saw it, from Egypt to Lebanon, including a detailed representation of Jerusalem with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at its heart. 

Travelling to the banks of the River Jordan itself, Dan then encounters archaeological discoveries revealing the veneration of this place‚Äôs association with Elijah and John the Baptist for centuries. This is believed to be Bethany Beyond the Jordan, a location where faith and history coincide as excavations have uncovered 5th century AD buildings commemorating the spot where early Christians believed John baptised Jesus and where His ministry began.

This is a fascinating journey into the past and the powerful connections made between faith and real places on the ground for millennia.

In the heart of Calgary in Alberta, Canada ‚Äî on land where the Bow and Elbow rivers have long brought people together ‚Äî another kind of gathering is taking place: a cultural movement stitched into fabric, design, and identity.
Indigenous fashion is rising, and it‚Äôs more than style. It's story.

Pati Jinich speaks with Chelsa Racette (Founder of Indigenous Fashion Week), Kim Coltman (Producer, Indigenous Fashion Week), and Tyson Martell (Model & Actor) to explore how indigenous fashion is reshaping the industry, reclaiming space, and creating new opportunities for indigenous creatives.
Chelsa started modeling over a decade ago and saw the lack of Indigenous representation firsthand. In 2012, she founded Indigenous Fashion Week to change that. Kim modeled in the 1970s, when she was not even called by her name and only referred to as ‚Äúthe Indian.‚Äù She shares how painful that was ‚Äî and how proud she is to now help open doors for others. They talk candidly about access, erasure, and the power of visibility. About how the runway can be sacred. About smudging before shows. About teaching young people that it‚Äôs okay to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm indigenous,‚Äù with pride.

What began as fashion shows has become a full-scale movement ‚Äî rooted in ancestry, but with eyes set firmly on the future. As Chelsa says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here and we‚Äôre human beings.‚Äù

When night falls, the most diverse worlds come together here. A journey through one of the most fascinating metropolises in the world -- from sunset to sunrise.

Shortly after sunset, work begins for the men and women who collect the garbage. On Copacabana Beach, a whole armada is out sifting through the sand and preparing the beach for the next day. Because the metropolis of millions is so busy all day, Luiz da Silva and his colleagues also empty the city‚Äòs garbage cans in the middle of the night. 

Meanwhile, crocodile researcher Ricardo Freitas sails his small boat in a lagoon, in the west of the city. The wild side of Rio comes to the fore at night: thousands of caimans populate the city's waters.

Jacky Rocha also works at night. She is a samba singer and tours Rio's nightlife, going from gig to gig. Her rehearsals for carnival are already in full swing. But she can always make time for a concert in the trendy harbor district. Samba, she says, is more than just carnival and good-mood music - it is a weapon in the fight against racism.

Rio de Janeiro is also a city of extreme inequality. While some people are still dancing and partying, others are starting their working day. Nanny Gilmara dos Santos lives in one of Rio's poor and dangerous suburbs. To get to work on time for a rich family in the wealthy south of the city, she has to leave her home at night.

Then there‚Äôs the world of Candombl√©: The Afro-Brazilian religion was banned for a long time and had to be practiced in secret. Even today, its practitioners must still contend with prejudice. During the hour-long night-time rituals, the gods, or ‚Äòorix√°s‚Äô, are summoned with drums, singing and dancing, to take possession of the believers.

All the different people the filmmakers meet are united by a tireless optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable social and economic hurdles. Rio de Janeiro at night shows viewers a city of hard work and big dreams. It‚Äôs a place that rewards its inhabitants, the Cariocas, with its beauty every morning, at sunrise

--

In 1943, chemist Albert Hofmann accidentally exposed himself to a drug he derived from ergot fungus and recorded its unexpected, mind-altering effects. The drug, lysergic acid diethylamide‚Äî or LSD‚Äî was soon heralded for its psychiatric potential. But how do LSD and other psychedelic drugs affect the body? And can they actually be medicinal? Anees Bahji explores the science of psychedelics.
